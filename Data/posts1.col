P1D1  The Toronto Public Library system is just kicking off a gigantic, ambitious speculative reading series that starts next Monday with Michael Skeet hosting a panel discussion with Karl Schroeder, James Alan Gardner and Peter Watts on the pursuit of foresight in Canadian science fiction. On April 31 May 1, Toronto Public Library will be launching my next novel, Little Brother, at an event at the Merril Collection, the astounding public science fiction reference library. Books will be on sale through BakkaPhoenix books, and they're taking pre-orders for signed/inscribed copies of the book to be mailed out to you (CDN$19.95 for the book, plus $9 and GST for shipping in Canada, $15 to the US, $20 to Europe, and $25 to the rest of the world). BakkaPhoenix: 416 963 9993, inquiries@bakkaphoenixbooks.com (Patient US readers who don't mind waiting until the end of May for their signed, inscribed copies can request them from San Francisco's Borderlands Books, who are not charging for domestic shipping. Borderlands: 888.893.4008, webmail@borderlands-books.com.) ###  Cory Doctorow ### April 19, 2008 6:24 AM

P11D1  "a YA novel that pits hacker kids in San Francisco against the DHS in a bid to restore the Bill of Rights to America" In other words, a anti-conservative rah rah propaganda rag.

P13D1  Why not the Constitution? It seems people only want to respect the wishes of the founding fathers only when it suites their own political agendas. For example the whole church and state issues. At the time the "Congress shall not" comment was made, they were teaching kids how to read in public schools using the Bible. I think with time, any document is going to be distorted to suite the political agenda of whoever wants it bad enough. Take a look at this ### KevinK ### April 19 2008 1:54 PM
P14D1  KevinK "Public schools" didn't depend on taxpayer funding back then. More than likely, they were run by the local churches. The idea that the government was responsible for primary education came along quite a bit later. Take a look at this ### Man On Pink Corner ### April 19 2008 2:09 PM

P18D1  Does the Bill of Rights say the Bible is required reading in public schools? It would be interesting to find out what printed materials were widely available in the US in the late eighteenth century to be used for educational purposes. I would imagine that the bible would have had a universal availability that made it useful, but the language would have been a century out of date. Take a look at this ### Antinous ### April 19 2008 2:35 PM
P19D1  "Public schools" as we understand them didn't exist in the 1700's. Until the 1840's education was for the wealthy only and varied locally. Free public education at the elementary level wasn't available for all children until the end of the 19th century. We owe a lot to Horace Mann. Jefferson believed that education should under the control of the government and free from religious bias. I like most of what he had to say but I doubt some people would really want that.

P22D1  "KevinK "Public schools" didn't depend on taxpayer funding back then. More than likely, they were run by the local churches." No, they were run by the locals. Basically the local townspeople that made up of what we'd call city hall. :p "The idea that the government was responsible for primary education came along quite a bit later." And when it did come around, the Bible wasn't banned from it then either. Not that I care either way. I am just showing how things have been distorted for people's political views before. "You're talking to a troll." Because you don't like what I have to say, I am suddenly a troll? Think about your post and who is being a troll. Take a look at this ### KevinK ### April 19 2008 3:39 PM

P33D1  Well, when it's done as part of drag it's called tucking. In a sexual context as far as I know it's called just what you'd expect: self-f***ing.

The problem is people aren't really attacking the true principles. They are attacking whatever "The other side" is doing no matter if it's right or wrong. And both sides are doing it. Lets just pretend Bush had a good idea, I know, I know hard to imagine. But lets pretend. How many true to form Liberals do you see giving him credit for it. And not bashing it just because it was HIS idea? Now remember, be honest. Don't say how you WANT it to be, or how you THINK it should be. But how it IS. Anyhow, I want to thank you anyhow for responding to my post in an honest and non-trollish way. I appreciate that. And you have my respect. Having said that, It was the same way when Clinton was in office. He could do nothing correct according to the Republicans. It's this silly political zealousness that is ruining our country.

P1D2  A damning piece by David Barstow in today's New York Times that chronicles "a symbiotic relationship where the usual dividing lines between government and journalism have been obliterated." Snip: Records and interviews show how the Bush administration has used its control over access and information in an effort to transform the analysts into a kind of media Trojan horse — an instrument intended to shape terrorism coverage from inside the major TV and radio networks. Analysts have been wooed in hundreds of private briefings with senior military leaders, including officials with significant influence over contracting and budget matters, records show. They have been taken on tours of Iraq and given access to classified intelligence. They have been briefed by officials from the White House, State Department and Justice Department, including Mr. Cheney, Alberto R. Gonzales and Stephen J. Hadley. In turn, members of this group have echoed administration talking points, sometimes even when they suspected the information was false or inflated. Some analysts acknowledge they suppressed doubts because they feared jeopardizing their access. A few expressed regret for participating in what they regarded as an effort to dupe the American public with propaganda dressed as independent military analysis. “It was them saying, ‘We need to stick our hands up your back and move your mouth for you,’ ” Robert S. Bevelacqua, a retired Green Beret and former Fox News analyst, said. Kenneth Allard, a former NBC military analyst who has taught information warfare at the National Defense University, said the campaign amounted to a sophisticated information operation. “This was a coherent, active policy,” he said. ### Xeni Jardin ### April 20, 2008 9:54 AM

P6D2  I watch a good amount of news and have never heard these analysts say anything too egregious and out of line with the rest of the discourse, both from major media and online. So maybe a line was crossed with this operation, but the effects have not been devastating like the article implies.

Now most people may hear that and they think oh my God, they're trying to brainwash -- Sec Rumsfeld: What are you some kind of a nut? You don't believe in the constitution? [Laughter].

P9D2  The lazy mainstream media will gladly air or print an expert who is handed to them rather than going out to investigate the range of opinions on a subject. The White House cleverly exploits this opportunity by providing military analysts who support their positions. It's a chicken/egg thing. They never seem out of line with conventional wisdom opinion because they're part of the mechanism producing that conventional point of view. I don't think there's anything approaching criminality about this, except for the media outlets' failure to disclose the military analysts' commercial connections to defense contractors, which is a pretty serious breach of what used to be journalistic ethics.

As much as I can diss the NY Times for occasional stodgyness, shoddy reporting, or other scandals, they do have a lot of well trained reporters who know how to put a story together, and they can put something like this together in a professional way. This was a hell of a story, and I hope it gets people to sit up and take notice that major media outlets are complicit in government propaganda.

Next,let's make you worry about your health: minus 5 IQ points- it's a big thing not to have coverage. Next your daily security; child molesters, terrorists, bloggers; minus 10 points. Now the environment and food safety; minus 3 more IQ points. Add a few more obvious ones.

P29D2  First, a quote: "Naturally the common people don't want war; neither in Russia, nor in England, nor in America, nor in Germany. That is understood. But after all, it is the leaders of the country who determine policy, and it is always a simple matter to drag the people along, whether it is a democracy, or a fascist dictatorship, or a parliament, or a communist dictatorship. [...]Voice or no voice, the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders. That is easy. All you have to do is to tell them they are being attacked, and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger. It works the same in any country."

P34D2  I defy you to prove me wrong. I'm self-employed, so worry about my paycheque is built in to my life. I'm a Canadian, so no worries about health care as related to employment. I live in the "bad" area of town, which I've never been able to quite get my head around because everywhere here is so vastly much safer than where I grew up. So no worries about all the supposed degenerates out there. I live in a small town with relatively clean environment and eat mostly whole foods that aren't a matter of concern. So not too worried about any of that either. Ergo, my stunningly high IQ is mostly intact. But I still gave tepid support to the invasion of Iraq because I could not believe that anyone would be so profoundly duplicitous as pursue a policy that would certainly kill thousands of young American men and tens or hundreds of thousands of innocent Iraqi civilians if there was not a clear and present danger to the United States. Particularly when it was obvious that the fraud would be exposed when no WMDs were found, and the perpetrators would obviously then be punished by due process of law. Which makes me think that having a stunningly high IQ is no barrier to being born stupid. Take a look at this ### Tom ### April 20 2008 6:54 PM

P36D2  #15 Media-wise, the difference between now and then is that there aren't a helluva lot of journalists around. Print, television and radio news staffs have been pared down to nothing. There are no reporters left to cover anything. What you are getting is McNews, produced cheaply at some central location and shipped out for mass consumption like so many batches of frozen fries. It bears no more resemblance to real news than the crap that is served at Applebee's or Taco Bell does to real food. And it is for the same reason: corporate profits. And if the slant seems, well, rather Republican, go reread what I just posted and ask yourself why. Doubt me? Just pick one major magazine, say like Time, or your local paper, and look up the stats on how many people, how many reporters they employed five years ago, ten years ago, fifteen years ago, twenty years ago. It is happening in TV and Radio too. And the creeps in charge whine that profits are down. The profits are not down, they just aren't increasing at the same crazy rate they had been.

Let Britney have a fender bender at 11:00 AM and it's lunchtime conversation in every office in the land. Wars fall somewhere in between. It's taken 3 or so years since the obvious failure of the stated mission in Iraq and it's just about sunk in to the public consciousness.

P56D2  @#42: Indeed. My mother, who pooh-poohs me as an angry young man (well, I am angry, but not so young anymore) when I tell her about things that are happening RIGHT NOW, will often come to me as much as a couple years later all in a huff about this terrible thing that happened TWO YEARS AGO and no one noticed. "Yeah, Mom, I know. In fact, I told you about it. You said I was being silly. Do you want me to dig up the email to prove it?" Even with all of the stunning developments in information dissemination and access, quite simply, the people can't keep up. They never could; that's why we have a republic with representatives. We trust the people we send to various governing bodies to represent our values and opinions. When they don't, people don't find out about it for a long time. When legislation goes as fast as it does these days, with so little time for public input, and no chance to fire people before they have a chance to vote on an issue the people don't support, the government can have its way with the people and, just as Gorring said, drag them along into any crazy-ass misadventure, be it killing off the rich people and taking their stuff (the Final Solution) or killing off the poor people and taking their stuff (the Iraq War). These are things that, when examined by individuals, no sane or thinking person (without a stake, of course) could support. But that doesn't matter, because they'll be involved before they even notice. When this happens, you can't really vote your way out of the trouble. When the governmental system becomes so septic and virile that it spreads beyond the hallowed halls into every corporate boardroom and from there into every living room in the land, when violence and death become its primary mode of discourse, it may become necessary to enter into debate with it in a language it understands.

LINCOLN: Sounds right -- his ex-wife was from Kentucky. STEPHANOPOULOS: Why did you remain in the church after hearing those statements? LINCOLN: I was eight. DOUGLAS: This is an important question George -- it's an issue that certainly will be raised in the fall. STEPHANOPOULOS: Do you denounce him?

P2D3  Yay - Nothing is more wonderful than politics! Seriously though, without trying to defend or defame the recent ABC "debate", there are a few fundamental differences between the Lincoln-Douglas debates - the candidates actually debated each other, they didn't try to score points and utter snappy sound-bites designed to appeal to certain demographics that only get their news via excerpts from the debates. Also, they were debating for a seat in the Senate (not President), and they were held in all but two districts in Illinois. The Lincoln Douglas debate was also between two parties, not an internal political party squabble, and is a well-regarded model for political (and other) debate. The ABC "debate" is more like an extended press conference with only two reporters and no editors. Of course, I understand the "attempt" at humor, but I'm annoyed at the FUD stirred-up by the inaccuracies (Sen. Obama attended the church in question as a grown man of his own choice, got married there, and has his daughters attend as well - that was characterized as a church he attended 40 years ago in the "parody" piece - not even close, IMHO, but opinions vary.). Personally, I'm more troubled by his "crazy uncle" defense of Rev. Wright - the huge, un-spoken difference between a "crazy uncle" and his former pastor is that you don't choose your crazy uncle, no more than President Carter "choose" to have Billy Carter (see "Billy Beer") as a brother... Oprah managed to find another church in Chicago, why couldn't Sen. Obama? Anyway, that's what makes politics o "wonderful" ;^) See: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lincoln-Douglas_debates_of_1858 for a pretty good background on the Lincoln Douglas debates of 1858.

P15D3  Debates should be about issues -- jobs, the environment, healthcare, the economy, Iraq, civil rights. It's a waste of time to detour. ("Someone else did this, but what do you think of it?!") Someone argued that in order to inject these "gotcha" moments, the media invented the non-issue of "character" so they'd have an excuse for getting gossip-y. The other standard syntax is a meta question -- if I ask you a really combative question, will you be able to deflect it well enough to prove you're worthy to be President?"

While I am sure Principal Jim's actions toward Johnny may have made Johnny feel that Principal Jim deserved it, we as adults know better. Well we should anyhow. "The Obama-ites are crying about mistreatment by the press???" Maybe not the press itself. But just those that are friends with Hillary that have dealings with the press. For example, that information that was leaked about Edwards by a magazine that was owned by one of Hillary's main supporters. She has had the ability to make more "friends" in the past 16 years compared to Obama. She has also had time to make more enemies too. That's why she is trailing behind.

P20D3  Concerning Dr. Wright: Of course, if you watch the full sermon, you'll see that Wright was quoting US Ambassador Edward Peck in a Fox interview when he spoke of "chickens coming home to roost". It was not and is not an extreme position, but Wright had the bad grace to express it in an angry way, and the bad grace to do so while black. Dr. Wright is an amazing man. He holds some dumbass views, I agree, but he founded one of the first AIDS ministries in Chicago's South Side, started a singles night for gays and lesbians in his congregation (against pressure from his more conservative members), welcomed German visitors to Trinity by giving a portion of his sermon in German (he speaks six languages), assisted in heart surgery on President Lyndon Johnson (and was commended twice by that President), earned a PhD and a stack of honorary doctorates, and has devoted thirty years of his life to doing God's work in Chicago. Yes, he's sometime angry and intemperate and blustrous, but this white boy holds him in high regard in spite of it. It is, frankly, intellectually dishonest to judge a thirty-year career based on thirty seconds of soundbites. I encourage everyone to watch a full sermon or two, and watch the testimonials from parishoners (white and black) who tell us how welcoming and accepting Trinity has been. Wright's gotten railroaded by a press that doesn't like looking fairly at unpopular opinions. Take a look at this ### jere7my Author Profile Page ### April 19 2008 12:25 PM

P31D3  KevinK, I recommend a multi-part documentary the BBC produced a few years back called the power of nightmares, which investigates the history of Al Queda and extreme Islamic terrorism in general. I remember, for instance, a clip of Reagan dedicating the Challanger space shuttle launch to the mujahadeen [proto-Al Queada], which is one of those things that you just have to laugh at...until the ball drops, then you cry and cry and cry, then get drunk and repeat. Having just finished reading Wilhelm Reich's 'Listen Little Man' [to summarise it in one sentence: 'everyone is a stupid stupid fascist, except me, I am not a fascist] I am uniquely qualified to give a response replete with the amount of cynicism appropriate to a discussion of the media in the United States. Do you know, I've seen almost every episode of the West Wing, and I still have no idea what the president actually does on a day to day basis? It seems like he [or she, why not?] basically corresponds to the English Queen: makes speeches on important occasions, travels around meeting people, lots of waving, dinner parties, but no real work. And of course, there's my pet thesis that George W. is the first reality tv president. I mean, he really is doing what any of us would do if we found ourselves president: abuse all the benefits of office, take as much time off as possible to catch up on all the universe wide comic book crossovers that came out in the last few years and let the experts handle the nitty gritty. If they made Congress into a reality tv show, I would watch the shit out of it. Still, I don't know how the network news gets away with it. The news is neither informative nor entertaining [unless you have a sick sense of humour]. I can't turn on a news channel without a sense of wide eyed, jaw dropping horror, that in the mind of a rational human being what I am watching could represent a fair and comprehensive survey of the world today. I loved especially that debate sponsored by YouTube a while back, where the audience opinion was scrolling across the screen in real time. First of all, you could tell the audience were not the brightest, since the rating never dropped below seven or so for any candidate. One rather wonders why the scale was one to ten, and not one to three, since clearly the public's scale of opinion of politicians is limited to perfect, superlative, and very very good, if the scrolling opinions were anything to go by. Either that, or the audience was doped up before the debate began. Anyway, this is all a pussyfooted way of saying, it isn't like the candidates themselves aren't superficial. I mean, i follow many people on this thread in not having a strong opinion on any candidate, but Obama's 'change' has to be the most superficial campaign in the history of politics. change from what to what? Politics 'changed' under Reagan and W. more than under any other administration, is that what he means? Or does he mean a change back to the status quo, the liberal consensus of Clinton? Change is a neutral term, without a context it means nothing. there's all this talk of changing attitudes and hope, but really I don't think people care about other people's attitudes and hope, I think people want more and better stuff. Why don't politicians use /that/ as a slogan? and why aren't they asking that in the debates? will your nomination lead to more and better stuff? Obama came the closest I suppose, with his 'vote for me and I'll give you a thousand bucks', but he really should have just promised a Wii in every home.

P45D3  When you say three of the strongest candidates in years, it is tempting to answer, well that isn't saying much. One of the interesting things in the American political system is that while the Israeli system, with no party ever taking a majority and the necessity to form coalitions in order to govern seems odd in comparison, in actual fact, the two parties are coalitions in themselves, so Del Miller [is that his name? The wack job from Georgia?] or Joseph Lieberman are democrats and Jack Reed, the former senator from Rhode Island, is a Republican, despite tending not to toe party lines. But in belonging to either party, and indeed between either party, there is a narrow consensus, in my opinion, on what seem to me the most important issues, namely economic ones. The Roosevelt era dependency of Democrats on unions has not only withered, but the unions themselves are no longer asking for anything other than what industrial owners are willing to give them, so there is minimal surface level conflict between working class people and richer type people, or indeed, any demands of working class people are by and large deemed irrelevant to electoral politics. Economic concessions to working people are limited to the preservation of jobs, not improving the quality of jobs, as though the average job today reflects an adequate use of and reward for the average person's actually quite surprising ability. Republicans, in my opinion, skirt economic issues entirely by appealing to social issues, which in actual fact are not as big of a deal as people tend to make of them. It isn't to say that something like abortion or prayer in schools aren't important [actually I don't honestly give a toss about prayer in schools; if it will shut them up, give it to them], but that it is not in principle the proper role of government to dictate social behaviour. McCain, it appears, is a subscriber to the patriotic aspect of the Republican party, where America is an absolute good, regardless of its actions, to which I am not sure there is an effective response, while the government continues to facilitate the flow of money from the poor to the rich. And I don't think any candidate has significantly deviated from this consensus. you don't see anyone saying, for instance 'we have to begin rewarding people for working, not for owning' or that as long as government is subsidising industry anyway, it might as well be subsidising health care, rather than a ridiculously bureaucratic and ineffectual military. i don't know. I'm not an expert on politics, and certainly haven't paid attention to the us campaign. Basically, i feel like what tends to be called an 'extremist' position in the uS media or in conversation, I would call, from what, I flatter myself, is an objective perspective, 'centre-right', and that the position of every politician currently in office falls within a spectrum of far right to centre right. Who cares what i think? but i strongly suspect that the proper course of action for those who do feel as i do that the US is more or less exactly the opposite of the ideal is simply to begin organising on a local level, even if that means sitting in a pub with the one or two other people who think the same way once a week or month or whatever and discussing particularly a reasonable further course of action. or start publishing an independent paper of sufficient quality as to actually merit reading, which is easier with each passing year, given the advance of technology. Again, I don't know, what sort of thing is appropriate. my political activity these days is limited to occasionally emailing my friends back home and yelling at them for not being more active in protesting the London Olympics, for which i have an irrational hatred on the basis of being evicted because of them, so anyone, do feel free to join me in that. I imagine I've fallen a bit behind the trend of the thread in the space of time it took to jot down the above... Take a look at this ### scottfree ### April 19 2008 6:05 PM
P46D3  McCain used to be kinda liberal. Bush Sr. started out his political career as an anti-racist. Even Reagan fooled around with communism. As far as I can tell, Republican presidents are usually fairly liberal in their personal sentiments.

I imagine a similar sort of thing happens in politics. One day, a big fat cigar smoking capitalist takes the idealist young politician aside and asks if he wouldn't mind a round of golf, in which our hero sees no harm. Having accepted, the monocle wearing captain of industry proceeds to impress on the flannel shirt wearing man of the people how difficult it is to be a millionaire and wonders aloud whether it wouldn't be possible for the politician to do this or that small favour.

P52D3  (Disclosure: I'm an Obama supporter, but not an Obamaniac. What I say below is meant to make a more general point, but I don't pretend I can hide my biases.) What will things be like when the MySpace generation starts running for president? They've all got at least one of the following online somewhere: 1) incriminating photos or videos of them drinking underage, flashing the camera, doing drugs, or some such; 2) blog posts/journal entries full of curse words, highly controversial opinions, accounts of morally questionable activities, etc.; 3) unflattering descriptions, unsavory rumors, etc., posted by friends; and so forth. Face it people: this focus on inanities is simply retarded. None of us are perfect and we all make decisions (do things, says things) that we later regret. If we continue to hew to the standards that the media would impose, only the most boring, preternaturally "wholesome" people would qualify for the presidency. Similarly, we should not judge people by what their relatives and friends say and do. That's just guilt by association. Why should I have to end relationships or "distance" myself from other people whenever they do things I don't agree with? Only in the most extreme cases would this even be relevant. (With respect to Rev. Wright, a lot of the problem here is a gap between white and black culture. The views he expresses are not nearly so shocking in the context of an urban African American community as they are in white suburbia. Asking Obama to sever his ties from his church is, as many have argued better than I, unreasonable.) What should matter when one runs for president or any other elected office are things like experience, judgment, policy positions, and the like. The problem with "character" is that, while it is important, it's not something that we get an accurate sense of in the media frenzy surrounding an election. Judging by their actions in the last 8 years, Al Gore is a much more principled, decent human being than Dubya could ever be, but that was not how he was portrayed prior to November 2000. Presidential politics is far from my favorite aspect of American government. As the founders well knew, the executive is not the most democratic of the three branches--there's a reason that Congress comes first in the Constitution. It's a shame that Americans seem to get worked up about politics only once every four years. Democracy requires more of its citizens if it is to sustained...

"I guess we trained them in the way the US army trained Timothy McVay. While yes, he was in the army, and yes he received training from our government, they didn't teach him to murder buildings full of innocent people because you think you are justified in doing so." yes we did, in afghanistan against the russians. (we did the same in nicuragua and we do the same in colombia right now) "The middle east has been violently disrupted for centuries. Where have you been?" just because the middle east has had violence forever, that doesn't make adding more (and more damaging) violence correct. that's pissing in a black eye. "Just being honest and realistic without the hyperbole." you may be being honest about your opinion, but the truth is luckily a collective hallucination, not just yours. and as far as the hyperbole, you've got plenty. "Eight years of disastrous American foreign policy, conducted by the Cheney Presidency... You mean the same foreign policy Clinton had?" I guess I am one of the few people here that remembers before 2001" while bill clinton was war-mongering and corrupt (see bombing sudanese pharmaceutical plants, nafta, etc...) he didn't manage to utterly destroy global trust in america the way bush has. calling their policies "the same" is hyperbole. oh and i remember before 2001 too, that's more hyperbole. @#34 posted by Takuan "and what can any one person do with this office? In the end, even the strongest and best intentioned are slaves of their machine." i agree mostly here, with two major exceptions. one was basically covered by antinous (some differences in policy can be implemented), the other is similar to what andrew #43 said... while the election is in many ways symbolic and the power at the mercy of the ecocidal military-industrial-consumer-complex, just the narrative that obama chooses is a powerful symbol both internationally and at home... it could say to the world, "we have stopped choosing the monkey, and now will choose the nice man". and the fact that there is some substance to his choice of narrative, and that he appears to have (and most likely does have) some conviction to at least attempt to perform his narrative makes the prospect even more alluring. for example, consider this quote from a recent post of mine about obama... it deals with the hip hop concept of "keeping it real" and why that is problematic when it relates to materialism, etc... "art can't just be a rear-view mirror, it also has to have a headlight out there, pointing to where we need to go" maybe i'm just biased because i'm an artist/musician/etc, but that's the ONLY quote i've ever heard a politican say about art, and it's true and useful. a guy like this would be a GREAT hood ornament, to use your metaphor. anyway, i agree with your concern for america's global impact. i also dig global socialism as an idea, especially in smaller affinity group or tribe models. the possibility of larger state socialism makes me weirded out, but so does our "democracy". i'm an anarchist, so i'll wait until there is a government that has as it's first goal to destroy itself to be really excited about state politics, and in the meantime i'll just vote (and encourage others to vote) for the most impressive hood ornament.

"This year it seems the democrats are banging the social issue drum with national health care and the rich poor "divide"." How did health care and the economy become social issues(?!) as if they're just the hobbyhorses of the religiously intolerant, like abortion and school prayer?

P62D3  "to use your metaphor, johnny wasn't rebelling against getting punished for tsomething he wasn't supposed to do, johnny was rebelling because he did what principal jim wanted and still got fucked over..." I guess our view of what happened is different. I mean yeah the army we trained to fight off the Russians (We were so evil to help those people!11) did what it was supposed to do. But that isn't why they attacked us. They attacked us because of our presence in the Middle East. Why were we there? Because Iraq attacked Kuwait. Osama didn't like the fact that there was US soldiers in his "holy land" that we were "desecrating" such land. That we should leave. That is what 9/11 was really about. That and our support of Israel. So if you are saying we deserved to get attacked because we had soldiers in the Middle East, then fine. If you think that's something to kill a bunch of people over fine. I don't agree. The only people responsible for that attack or those that carried it out, and planned it. "yes we did, in afghanistan against the russians. (we did the same in nicuragua and we do the same in colombia right now)" Please show me examples of how we trained them to kill innocent victims in terrorists attacks. You know, like the ones that has happened to us since the 70s. "just because the middle east has had violence forever, that doesn't make adding more (and more damaging) violence correct. that's pissing in a black eye." Ok so you admit that it was a mess before we got there at least. I don't think we are really making it worse. Before something gets better, it usually does get worse. I know it was that way with this country. Will be in the future as well. "you may be being honest about your opinion, but the truth is luckily a collective hallucination, not just yours. and as far as the hyperbole, you've got plenty." I am not the one exaggerating claims or happenstances. "while bill clinton was war-mongering and corrupt (see bombing sudanese pharmaceutical plants, nafta, etc...) he didn't manage to utterly destroy global trust in america the way bush has. calling their policies "the same" is hyperbole." LOL! The "global" trust thing was PURE media spin and you know it. And yes, Clinton was the START of the embarrassment. I remember being on IRC back in the 90s and having people make fun of our country because of Billy Boy. Again, some people either don't remember the 90s, or are history re-visioning. Yes Bill had his friends. Mostly corrupt people that supported terrorism like Arafat. (He visited Bill the most of any political leader) So yes, the terrorists liked Bill more. And yes, the terrorists hate Bush even more. So even more FUD is going to be spread. The two are equally dim. They BOTH said the SAME THINGS about Iraq. The only difference is, during the 2004 election the left decided to take an about face and act like they ever supported Iraq to win the election. And it backfired on them.

P63D3  OK, let's put aside the headmaster metaphor completely. (Illustrative as the choice of the dominant position for the US therein may be.) The "real" reason the attacks on "9/11" were organised was to manipulate the US into a knee-jerk reaction in the Middle East, so as to shift public opinion in Islamic Middle Eastern countries (which is, for the most part, extremely moderate) towards radical Islamism. The Islamists succeeded admirably, in that you have invaded not one but two Middle Eastern nations, and are rattling sabres at a third, all of which has had the desired effect on public opinion in the Middle East. Anyway, to the point of how you share some blame for "9/11": During the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, you chose to support and train radical Islamist fundamentalists as a means of furthering your own political agenda. (And please don't come with "we were just helping the poor Afghanis out against an evil invader" - if that invader had been anyone but a major Communist power, you wouldn't have lifted a finger.) You manipulated them, but in the process gave them the tools and set the example for them to manipulate you back. Take a look at this ### Kieran O'Neill ### April 20 2008 7:29 AM
P64D3  And as for "the terrorists" hating Bush: Down in the rank-and-file of those organisations, I'm sure they do, and that the same (in reverse) is true of the rank-and-file of the US government/military/nation. But the Bush Administration and the upper echelons of Al Quaeda are each others' best friends, and I'm pretty sure they realise this. They give each other fantastic excuses to pursue and further their own political agendas. Terrorist actions give excuses for invasions and vice versa, with the side benefit to the Neocons of asserting "America's global preeminence", and the side benefit to the Islamists of radicalising Middle Eastern politics and society.

You know, like the ones that has happened to us since the 70s." fist off, the army kills innocent civilians in vast numbers. some might argue that it is an attack "in kind". infact we've killed hundreds of times more civilians than al qaeda, but you aren't ranting against us... but here are your examples... afghanistan - this paper sums it up nicely... "(the u.s.) is waging a domestic war against terrorism, operating in some respects independently of the CIA which has --since the Soviet-Afghan war-- supported international terrorism through its covert operations." the mujadeen also greatly increased heroin production, which i only bring up because i am soon going to talk about colombia. nicuragua - this wiki sums up nicely the "psychological operations in guerilla warfare" actions of the cia, which included for the murder of innocents. from that manual "to provoke riots or shootings, which lead to the killing of one or more persons, who will be seen as the martyrs; this situation should be taken advantage of immediately against the Government to create even bigger conflicts." colombia - plan colombia. this wiki deals with it well. some quotes... "Colombian security forces, which receive aid and training from (the u.s. initiative), are involved in supporting or tolerating abuses by right-wing paramilitary forces against the population and left-wing organizations." also, "aerial fumigation to eradicate coca. This activity has come under fire because it damages legal crops and has adverse health effects upon those exposed to the herbicides" this is doubly problematic because most of the farmers of coca are forced into it, either by the drug cartels or economic circumstances. "Ok so you admit that it was a mess before we got there at least. I don't think we are really making it worse. Before something gets better, it usually does get worse. I know it was that way with this country. Will be in the future as well." we're not making it worse? basically forcing civil war through localized oil barons, over a million deaths from the current iraq war, taking a much greater percentage of oil revenues away nationally from the iraqis than they had under saddam. so i guess were making it better, if that means killing more people, giving them less money, and fucking up the environment and infrastructure. call that better to one of the children we "liberated" from their limbs. "They BOTH said the SAME THINGS about Iraq." i'm not arguing that. but their policies are what is more important. clinton bombed iraq, but didn't invade. that's not the only difference. "I am not the one exaggerating claims or happenstances." i still claim that saying no one remembers before 2001 is hyperbole, as is claiming clinton and bush have identical policies. i'd also still argue that while i am making large claims, they are backed up by history enough to not be hyperbole. that's a minor point compared with your other, more misleading portrayals.

P66D3  @kevink "Please show me examples of how we trained them to kill innocent victims in terrorists attacks. You know, like the ones that has happened to us since the 70s." jamesgyre mentioned Nicaragua, and that's a pretty good example. Specifically the CIA's "Psychological Operations in Guerrilla Warfare" manual for the Contras which details methods of how to provoke the killing of civilians and the best ways to assassinate various officials, judges and so on. Beyond the more obvious examples like that, is there really a meaningful difference between training, funding and arming groups who blatantly engage in terrorism, and actually directly training or instructing them to carry out specific acts of terrorism? That sounds pretty similar to the whole issue of supplying 'dual-use' chemicals/weapons to the likes of Saddam while being fully aware of what he's doing with them. "They attacked us because of our presence in the Middle East. Why were we there? Because Iraq attacked Kuwait." The 'presence' in that part of the world goes back a lot longer than the last 20 years. Our countries have been installing/propping up nasty dictatorships and regimes and overthrowing/subverting democratic governments and movements in the Mideast for a helluva long time. I suppose in terms of an example which is massively relevant to today's situation, interference in Iran would be the obvious one. Decades of foreign policy have contributed to the 'blowback' being felt today. Take a look at this ### deadflagblues ### April 20 2008 8:36 AM
P67D3  #60 Nick, But I see you don't bother to enlighten me as to what the president actually does. What does that one [wo]man, the person every is so proud of voting for, do once [s]he gets elected? Ok, start wars is one, but in that case, what does a president do if he or she doesn't want to start a war? What does the president do to earn his room and board, other than volunteer to be a source of amusement for the general public, again, like the English royal family? I'll mention, of course, I am not one of those who thinks Europe is so superior, and also, as a point of interest, it might do to mention that the stock epithet for Blair and now Brown is 'Yankee Poodle'. The sixties radical connexion is nothing new in Europe, however, particularly Germany, where everyone in the SPD seems to have been involved in someway or another in the Autonome movement. Gerhard Schroder, the former President, I seem to remember, defended the Baader Meinhof gang in court, which would've been something like Hilary Clinton defending Sadaam. And most of the English Labour party were involved in some sort of activism early on. Take a look at this ### scottfree ### April 20 2008 12:18 PM

P70D3  Good answer, Scottfree. (And no, I'm not being sarcastic.) I have to give it to Jim H. for conciseness, though ("The President is the decider"). Besides trying to be funny, I was sort of hinting at the fact that I and many others are appalled by the imperial quality of the presidency, especially as Bush has interpreted its powers. So speculating that the Chief Executive appears at photo opps and acts as a sort of figurehead in a flowered hat like the Queen struck me as funny. Your other comments were very well-thought out, though, if I may say so. But per the President: the Chief Executive in this country is, after all, coequal with both the Legislative Branch and the Judicial Branch. He is the Commander-in-Chief. He appoints Supreme Court Justices. He is able to declare martial law, and to order many kinds of military actions on his say-so alone. The President has all sorts of discretionary powers that allow him to act without the approval of either of the other branches of government. An example is the Faith Based Initiative, wherein the Executive Branch gives taxpayers' money to religious groups. This has been challenged in the Supreme Court, seperation of church and state being cited. The Court ruled that since the money (not his persoanl money, remember, but taxpayers' money) is contained in a fund earmarked fo his use, that neither of the other branches of government can tell him how to spend it. At all. If he wanted to build $40 million dollar Baptist church with a creationist museum attached, in other words, there is no way to stop him under current law. See Guantanamo Bay for other examples of the imperial presidency. Take a look at this ### Nick D ### April 20 2008 5:28 PM

P74D3  ""Abortion and school prayer are dead issues even for the republicans."" "You can't really believe this, can you? How about Creationism (oops, sorry: Intelligent Design)? Is that a dead letter, too?" This is a straw man argument. Yes I really do believe this. School prayer and (the possibility of baning) abortion are decided issues. We've been hashing them out for decades. While there are finer points still undecided, at this point there is no chance either could come about. And no, as much as I disagree with ID its not a dead issue. But its largely a local issue. It has not entered the national election debate to any great extent. Its insulting to me, that you seem to assume all republicans only vote on religious issues. ""This year it seems the democrats are banging the social issue drum with national health care and the rich poor "divide"."" "How did health care and the economy become social issues(?!) as if they're just the hobbyhorses of the religiously intolerant, like abortion and school prayer? Is there someone in America who doesn't have a body or is not part of the economy? And the rich-poor "divide" (I love those quotes!) is a matter of statistical fact, not ideology." Access to health insurance is obviously a social issue. Just because its not religious doesn't make it not a social issue. religion is not a synonym for social issue. I use quotes for "divide" because its just a political flak word. Its used because it ignores the possibility of upwards mobility among the population. I'm not saying theres not a difference between rich and poor people but the term divide is misleading. On the whole the democratic approach seems to be more about social justice than consideration for the economy. Hence all the protectionist rumblings on free trade. ### prodigous ### April 21 2008 2:14 AM
P1D4 A single village in China is responsible for cranking out 60% of the world's paintings. The overwhelming majority of the paintings are slavish reproductions of famous paintings. The artists doing the work are very talented, however, and an organization called Regional asked some of the artists to paint themselves. The results are incredible. Dafen is a village surrounded by the thriving metropolis of Shenzhen, and the origin of most of the world’s reproduction oil paintings. In the popular imagination Dafen’s artists produce anonymous works for unknown customers, operating no differently than a faceless factory churning out counterfeits, replicas and nothing close to what would be considered art. Regional productively collaborated with the otherwise commoditized community in Dafen by asking selected individuals, some for the first time, to imagine themselves in their professional medium. The final works show the technical, creative, and professional facets of the artists identities subsumed by the styles and relationships they maintain with specific famous artists. The hybrid result of original subject with derivative style comments on originality, global cultural production and Regional's cooperation with emerging enterprise forms that are internationalizing the village. ### Mark Frauenfelder ### April 18 2008 5:23 PM | permalink

P9D4  They're definitely skilled and it's a bummer that they make sofa art, because their self-portraits are compelling. As to talent, I'm going to define it as an aspect of dharma, one's intrinsic nature. Some people have a natural affinity for certain types of processes and others have affinities for different ones, just as people are primarily visual, auditory or kinesthetic. A 'talent' for painting might include a primary visual orientation, good hand-eye coordination, greater ability to differentiate colors, etc. Like intellect, it would be a cluster of discreet, yet interrelated, abilities. How's that? Take a look at this ### Antinous ### April 18 2008 7:03 PM
P10D4  I would imagine talent to be: having proficiency in a certain combination of discrete human-physiological/psychological abilities, that when utilised within the terms of a discipline or pursuit, would give the person some advantage. For instance, I may have great pattern-recognition/spacial-awareness/timing-of-movement which may lead to being a talented animator. Or I may have an acute-mathematical-brain/dexterous-fingers/good-improvisation-skills and turn out to be a jazz musician.. I don't at all think there is such thing as a pianist or artist "talent", but I definitely think, that each of our brains and bodies are differently configured in infinitely small - but significant- ways, so as all the discrete functions are weighted slightly differently, leading each of us to have propensities for abilities that require differing combinations of micro-abilities, leading to macro-talent. Take a look at this ### arkizzle ### April 18 2008 7:17 PM
P11D4  I would presume that not every reproduction-painter becomes as skilled as the ones featured in the article, and that the ones who have lasted the distance had some combination of micro-abilities to give them some sort of propensity toward painting.. eg. these are the talented ones (indeed, I'd venture most of the people working - because you don't get paid if it isn't any good- are the talented ones).

P15D4  Cool, but totally unsurprising that the village of copyists turns out some real talent. Back on the Old Master days, a lot of the training was just straight copying. Still is - sometimes, you can learn a lot more straight from Van Eyck than you can from a two-bit art school teacher. In the old days, apprentices copied, sold their copies as copies (pre-photography, right?), and thus paid their way while they learned via their copying. Basically, this is the exact same thing going on. Take a look at this ### rorschah ### April 18 2008 8:51 PM

P17D4  Martypants has a good point. Creativity, perhaps even 'talent' are sublimations of survival instincts. Driving a car is a highly technical skill, but the societal pressures to learn that skill and the fact that a mistake may cost you your life make for incentives to master it. Being an artist and art instructor, I impress upon my students the traditional skills of painting and drawing are actually not much more technically difficult than driving, but the incentives for the latter are far more influential than for the former.

P25D4  The idea that 60% of the world's reproduction paintings come from a single village in China doesn't sound so farfetched to me, considering what Peter Hessler found in southern Zhejiang Province in his recent National Geo story: "At Qiaotou, I stopped to admire the 20-foot-high silver statue of a button with wings that had been erected by the town elders. Qiaotou's population is only 64,000, but 380 local factories produce more than 70 percent of the buttons for clothes made in China. In Wuyi, I asked some bystanders what the local product was. A man reached into his pocket and pulled out three playing cards—queens, all of them. The city manufactures more than one billion decks a year. Datang township makes one-third of the world's socks. Songxia produces 350 million umbrellas every year. Table tennis paddles come from Shangguan; Fenshui turns out pens; Xiaxie does jungle gyms.

P38D4  Noen, I agree with you on the subject of "talent". Below is a quote from a review of an excellent book, "Ten Thousand Things: Module and Mass Production in Chinese Art", by Lothar Ledderose: "Chinese workers in the third century b.c. created seven thousand life-sized terracotta soldiers to guard the tomb of the First Emperor. In the eleventh century a.d., Chinese builders constructed a pagoda from as many as thirty thousand separately carved wooden pieces. In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, China exported more than a hundred million pieces of porcelain to the West. As these examples show, the Chinese throughout history have produced works of art in astonishing quantities--and have done so without sacrificing quality, affordability, or speed of manufacture. How have they managed this? Lothar Ledderose takes us on a remarkable tour of Chinese art and culture to explain how artists used complex systems of mass production to assemble extraordinary objects from standardized parts or modules. As he reveals, these systems have deep roots in Chinese thought--in the idea that the universe consists of ten thousand categories of things, for example--and reflect characteristically Chinese modes of social organization. Ledderose explains that Chinese artists, unlike their Western counterparts, did not seek to reproduce individual objects of nature faithfully, but sought instead to mimic nature's ability to produce limitless numbers of objects."

I feel that all your skills come from your experiences in life whatever muscles you use most for the first part of your life are the ones that you will feel most comfortable to use later on that includes parts of the brain so basically all talent is "learned" talent because no one was born with more than anyone else, though some were born with less, everyone started from the basically the same place: a weak and small being whos potential was near limitless and was only limited by how they thought and moved because: babies do think, in fact most of the things that are ground so deep in our minds we don't ever have to think about them are thoughts or feeling that we had when we were laying in a crib, sitting on the floor, crawling around the house, finding things that gave you wonder and influenced how you interact with all things that you would come to find in your life, which in turn influence how you would react. react to things that are more complex that cause you to think more complexly but with the root of the grain going back to your simple beginnings so that you can now choose how you will respond to a situation and how you will act in lack of a situation(free-time)builing your hobbies and therfore "talents" Take a look at this ### coldheart7 ### April 19 2008 11:47 AM

When you guys review this manufactured art, the people that do it poorly often have a brilliant edge of originality to their work because they can't do the knocking off right. But you always miss these undiscovered geniuses because all you care about is your boring marketing plan. Andy Warhol was brilliant because he couldn't get Abstract Expressionism right. But you marketing assholes that are killing true art are just like these painters--you don't have an original bone to speak of. You're just subconciously copying more Warhol ideas. But you think you're great cause now you did you're self portait marketing plan. But guess what? You're just bus driver marketers. The real marketing geniuses are looking in the totally opposite direction. So you're bus driver marketers that have in fact, missed the bus. But what you're doing is easier than brilliant art marketing, so you're clogging the art world with insignificant clutter. So why don't you go and do your 60% of the worlds marketing in the Procter and Gamble village and leave us alone... Take a look at this ### ART C ### April 19 2008 12:15 PM

P52D4  This has been an interesting discussion, but I don't see mention of two important elements. I believe for a discussion of "talent" you ought to include "passion." You can teach someone the skills to use materials, and they may or may not have the propensity to pick it up with any degree of expertise, but when you add passion to those skills, then I think you get creativity - you get creative leaps. Also, I believe there is a very great difference in calling mass produced reproductions "art," and works created individually from the mind and heart of the artist. Originality, passion, leaps of creativity beyond the simple use of skills - could not these components be part of "talent?" Take a look at this ### LindaArtist ### April 19 2008 12:27 PM

P56D4  #51, I'm not sure people are calling the mass-produced works "Art" (i'm certainly not), but the self-portraits (some more than others) are really very good, and are absolutely individual works (if not entirely original, 3 of the 6 are as originial as any day-to-day gallery might display). Also, there really is a difference between art and Art, maybe not with an established convention, but certainly colloquially, and maybe we need to define the two better. Interestingly, a portion of work that has come down from the renaissance masters was completely observational, with not much discernable difference in style from painter to painter, and no amazing-hidden-truth, including self portraits. It's mostly technique, and we love it. Here are some well executed self-portraits, but because they were done by professional copyists (in factory-nation China) rather than long-suffering, bay-area art school graduates, they are suddenly judged on some lofty, holier-than-thou scale.. If we saw some of those portraits on gallery walls, we would be impressed. Yes, some are derivative, some not. Like all art, or Art. Take a look at this ### arkizzle ### April 19 2008 1:02 PM
P57D4  There is one thing people have all forgotten: most of the reprodution paintings are western style paintings with orders from abroad; few if any are Chinese style paintings. The need for those reproduction paintings is from the west, not from China. Indeed, if you have ever visited an original painting market in China, you would notice that most of the paintings there are of Chinese style. The Chinese painters may paint reproductions for a living. However, they may not be able to find the resonance within them to have enough passion. There is a culture gap. And that's the same reason why real Chinese style paintings never enter the western market. Take a look at this ### wind ### April 19 2008 1:11 PM

Mona Lisa's a little weird, but the landscapes and fruit bowls are generic enough that most people are unfamiliar with the originals. Successful sculptors now commonly design a piece and have it executed by minions, sometimes in multiple. I wouldn't be surprised to see painting go the same way. It would be like buying a limited edition print, except painted. Needless to say, many artists are horrified that potential customers might buy a $100 painting from China rather than their own original artwork. I don't know that I think that the markets have that much overlap. Take a look at this ### Antinous ### April 19 2008 2:55 PM

They were absolutely done production-line style, and sold to American tourists. Even though there was slight variation from canvas to canvas, they were generally the same picture, over and over, and standing in front of the seller, you could clearly see the sameness, yet people would lap them up. It's not so different here really (with the reproductions), and come to think of it, when I was in Morocco a few years ago, Essaouira had a similar trade.

It was last updated at 00:00 on April 20 2008. As Chinese nationalism flares across cyberspace, the government is growing concerned that passions could spill over into the real world, and that anger directed against foreigners could turn inward. Critics contend that Beijing has had a role in fanning the xenophobic sentiment to counter international condemnation of its crackdown on Tibetan rioters, but now Chinese officials appear to be trying to reduce the vitriol. Chinese censors have quietly warned cyber-police and internet businesses to delete all information related to protests against Western policies, nations or companies that have proliferated in the wake of demonstrations surrounding the global Olympic torch relay and high-level calls to boycott the opening ceremony of the summer games in Beijing. A notice issued last week by China's 'Internet Inspection Sector' instructs recipients to reset the keywords used to block access to certain websites, relay the instructions through all internet distribution channels and then delete the notice in a timely manner. 'Such information has shown a tendency to spread and, if not checked in time, could even lead to events getting out of control as they did with the 9 April incident against Japan,' says the censors' notice.

P75D4  hilarious part is Carrefour is telling the truth and has nothing to do with it all By ANDREW JACOBS and JIMMY WANG Published: April 20, 2008 BEIJING — Armed with her laptop and her indignation, Zhu Xiaomeng sits in her dorm room here, stoking a popular backlash against Western support for Tibet that has unnerved foreign investors and Western diplomats and, increasingly, the ruling Communist Party. Over the last week, Ms. Zhu and her classmates have been channeling anger over anti-China protests during the tumultuous Olympic torch relay into a boycott campaign against French companies, blamed for their country’s support of pro-Tibetan agitators. Some have also called for a boycott against American chains like McDonald’s and Kentucky Fried Chicken. On Friday and Saturday, protesters gathered in front of a half-dozen outlets of the French retailer Carrefour, including a demonstration in the central city of Wuhan that reportedly drew several thousand people, according to Agence France-Presse. On Saturday, about 50 demonstrators carrying banners held a brief rally at the French Embassy here before the police shooed them away. For the moment, however, most of the outrage is confined to the Internet. More than 20 million people have signed online petitions saying they plan to stop shopping at the Carrefour chain, Louis Vuitton and other stores linked to France because of what they see as the country’s failure to protect the torch during its visit to Paris two weeks ago.

P80D4  The advent of the camera obliterated for the layperson the motive for a study of drawing and painting. Yes, I remember that lesson from the first time I did art history. Unfortunately it's a far too simplistic view of the many-limbed beast that is both personal expression, and personal enjoyment of other's expression. It's esstentially like saying that playing the drums became redundant when drum machines were invented, or playing music at all, with the invention of sequencers. Unfortunately for that position (and fortunately for us) realistic/photorealistic/hyperrealistic drawing and painting have enjoyed a growing, happy, diverse history since the camera initially caused artiists to turn to the more expressionistic/interperative/abstract styles. And although realistic representaton did lose ground, the ubiquitousness of the camera, has made a good drawing even more valuable, and made the layperson appreciate the difference.

P84D4  Being an artist myself, there are some points here that I would like to add my comments to, which might elude those who have not attempted, over years of work, to create 'art'. There is something called "technique". It can be taught and learned. The Chinese apparently called in the Italians who taught them the techniques of glazing, underpainting, color palette, impasto, etc.. When a Masterpiece such as the Mona Lisa is copied, one merely applies these techniques, and renders the image via a copying technique, and voila! you have another Mona Lisa... sort of. Copying is not difficult to do, and is also an excellent learning process, which one can then apply to painting one's own paintings. But this is where the rubber meets the road, and this is where something which might be called 'talent' or 'vision' or 'genius' might come into play.. or not. There is a lot of art today which uses little or no 'schooled' technique, and is regarded as 'art' because it is colorful, shocking, pretty, interesting, or triggers associations in the viewer's mind. Either way, it can legitimately be called art. But as one learns more about art, and what constitutes good or great art, one learns that there is much more to it than appearances. For instance, did you know that the smile that plays about the corners of Mona Lisa's mouth is the result of Leonardo deeply investigating the optical illusions that are occur naturally when the human eye roves over an object? The retinal cells see slightly differently than the pupil, thus something can be made to appear when viewed indirectly, but is not as visible when viewed directly. There is so much more to say about his use of shadowing and color, but suffice it to say that this genius worked long and hard to produce this painting which is universally regarded as a masterpiece. And yes, Leonardo was talented. Talent is something many of us have, but few of us use. It can be honed through diligent work and many other factors, which may include adequate income, encouragement and passion, or not. We may admire someone who makes the effort to try something that we have not attempted, and we call them 'talented'. But for those who have worked in the creative fields, or any field for that matter, there is something that sets some people apart from others... they are good at what they do, better than most, be it in social relations, marketing, music, programming... whatever. It's an inscrutable combination of factors, who knows what it is... ? But their results show something extraordinary. When we look at the self-portrait of this Chinese artist, we are struck by the technical proficiency first.. it IS a good painting, in that regard. But great portraiture has something else going for it, just as great literature does. It looks deeper, sees further, and shows us something that we may not have seen without the hand of the artist to bring it into view. The difference between an artist and a copyist, is much like the difference between a musician who only does covers, and has no original work. Oh, they may put together something which can be called their unique work, but the sound, the ideas, the style, the innovation, freshness, tilt, power.. whatever you want to call it... is not a contribution to the artform. It is a repetition. A good one, perhaps, but not one which awes us, wins our heart and comes to live inside us as a star in the firmament of music. Artists... real artists in all fields... reach deeply inside themselves, into those areas where most never venture, and return with treasures that enrich our world. In traditional Asian arts, this is a process of approaching perfection inside an established artform... for instance, Ink Landscapes. He or she is regarded as a master when he can accomplish a visually beautiful landscape painting with a brevity of strokes, each stroke a perfection of line and touch. It can take many years to reach this level. Some are naturally talented, yes, and can do marvellous things rather early in their career, but they work diligently at it and continue to perfect themselves. Modern Western art does not limit itself to traditional artforms or syles. We are wide open, and it becomes more difficult to discern what is better art than most. This is where the viewer's eye must be educated... good or great art is partly technique, and greatly heart and feeling... and many a grizzled artist would tell you there is an element of luck at work. Not all their work are masterpieces. Very few are. For most of the art-buying public, these Chinese reproductions are all they need to decorate their homes. It requires no discernment, it looks good over the couch, and it is already accepted by their peers, and won't challenge any of their friends too much. Wherein lies the secret behind the New York art market... but that's for another post. Take a look at this ### Upupnduppy ### April 20 2008 12:42 PM

Who's making these reproductions and stealing business right out from under the artists? The guys this article tries to cast in a positive light. These "artists" are not artists, they are thieves and they have absolutely no respect for the true artists they steal from. The general art buying public is not "sophisticated" enough in the goings-ons of the other side of the art market to recognize fraud. Quite often the fraudulent paintings are sold under the name of one single person, as if that person created an original. So you see, I resent these criminals being called artists.

P90D4  I think there is two different conversations going on here.. I don't think anyone is saying that the reproductions are to be lauded as art, I imagine most people would consider this a fraudulent act (certainly for lesser known works, everyone knows the Mona Lisa and Van Gogh stuff, and wouldn't mistake them for original painting, more on the level of a print or poster). However, just because these people may have a job that makes them a criminal, you can't judge them as not artists for that reason. Their work (not their reproductions) may be Art (or not) but that is not dependent on their profession. A bank robber may be an artist by day.. One has no bearing on the other. That said, each 'artist' listed above may indeed have been unduly influenced by the works they reproduce everyday, but I've been influenced by many amazing artists too, and an observer could probably see the influences in my work, but that wouldn't sway me from being an artist or not.. maybe a crap one, but an artist nonetheless ### arkizzle ### April 21 2008 3:54 AM

Some people might argue that there's a right to privacy here, but when you send extremely hateful mail over the internet from your school address, and especially when you're a public relations officer, you pretty much give up that right. The internet is full of real bastards who posts hateful things all the time, and seemingly takes pleasure in hurting people. It's nice to see this one get his comeuppance.

P5D5  This is why the internet needs Teresas. Seriously, personal attacks don't foster a conversation or even a useful argument. They just make people feel terrible and scare people out of the discussion. It's how the bullies win. I like to play "Logical Fallacy Bingo" with stuff like this, where you win if you can identify five distinct logical fallacies in a single e-mail or comment. Usually, though, it's just ad hominem after ad hominem. And no matter how silly and artless (ignorant cunts indeed), it hurts if it's directed toward you. I'm still undecided as to whether I approve of the outing tactic, though. Where do you draw the line between outing someone for a hateful piece of vitriol, and outing them for holding a controversial position? Let's say I sent a similar letter to an anti-gay church. Is it ethical for them to out me as being pro-gay-rights to my Christian boss? Take a look at this ### Sister Y ### April 18 2008 5:48 PM
P6D5  I'm in college and a republican--pretty moderate, but a republican--and recognize that it's assholes like this that gives most republicans a bad name. I think they get caught up with the silly part of politics: hating the opposition, focusing on insignificant parts of fringe ideology, etc. For instance, I went to a group meeting for class and was wearing a vaguely liberal looking shirt (the woot one with the corporate logos saying "BUY" and "Consume"), and the first thing the two College Republicans do is call me a liberal...they went on to spend the rest of the meeting making stupid jokes about hating the environment and children (sarcastically, but still). On the other hand, many young liberals simply talk about hating Bush and conservatives without having any knowledge of what they're talking about also.

P46D5  "I wonder how his "you can't argue with science" philosophy jibes with the prevailing views Republicans hold on global warming and evolution." For one, global warming is being called "Climate Change" now. So stop calling it global warming. It's making us look silly. Global cooling didn't catch on. Global Warming however did. Until recently when certain scientists started speaking out about how we really don't know what is going on, then it was renamed climate change. Can't argue "climate change" because after all, it's changing all the time. "Climate Change" scare is BIG BUSINESS and BIG POLITICS. Claiming that anyone that doesn't blindly buy into this is somehow ignorant is actually close minded. For those that seem to have no problem reminding others how open minded they are, those that blindly support "Global " surely don't practice it.

P64D5  I still enjoy a good troll now and again. But there are ground rules: 1) Spell and punctuate correctly. You don't want to just look like an idiot wingnut and be (rightfully) dismissed as such. 2) Use foul language sparingly. Same reason as #1. 3) Strive for at least internal logical consistency. Don't leave claims unsupported (even if it's just anecdotal support), etc. Composition 101. The point of a good trolling post is to not be an ass, as I see it. It's to upset people. It's to shock them. You don't have to totally believe what you are saying; you just have to make a contrarian case that is strong enough to expose the knee-jerkers in the crowd (when they can't defend their beliefs when challenged) and let the real thinkers rise to the top and either concede parts of your diatribe or utterly destroy it with superior writing and/or logic. Either way, sanity and rationality and honesty win the day. To be honest, I don't really consider such posts as "trolls," but many disagree. I just think that, when arguing with strangers, there's no reason to cop to playing devil's advocate. We just do that face-to-face to preserve friendships with people we have to see again and again. This guy, however, is not that kind of troll. He's just a moron. I've known a lot of moronic College Republicans. Okay, almost all of them. But out in the wild, I know a lot of really smart Republicans. I may disagree with them, but at least they have their facts straight. Both parties have gone way downhill (or maybe we're just sophisticated enough to notice). The shit we argue about these days is ridiculous. There's room for social and economic conservatism, and there's room for social and economic liberalism. Democracy is supposed to let people find a balance among those four poles. But we don't even talk about those things anymore. We talk about flag burning and weather. Poli-tainment. (Retch.) Take a look at this ### Kyle Armbruster ### April 19 2008 6:08 PM

P77D5  "Wow. There's some insightful commentary. It really made me think. What it made me think was: has this person ever read a newspaper or seen a news broadcast?" Yes I have. I've been around long enough to notice that the extremes of both sides, while they may believe in different things, they act the same. They are the very people they hate. "You know that man you hate? You look like him every day!" Idiots indeed rule. I was watching a special on Lewis Black last night. He hit it on the nail. Anyone that looks up to Bush OR Clinton has low standards. They both were liars, and they both didn't take responsibilities for their actions. This isn't a troll. This is just the honest truth. I am not taking sides here. "I know you're not an elitist college graduate or anything, Kevink, but it's "wack," not "wacked." Or does knowing slang make me an elitist?" Actually if you knew slang, you would know that there is no "proper" form of it. That it changes daily. Different localizations too if you will. Both "wack" and "wacked" are used. Not that it matters. You just took what I said, ignored the statement and attacked some silly inane part of it that has no bearing on the discussion. And you did it in a pretentiously condescending way. THAT is trolling. "Now it's pretentious and condescending to be able to speak English at a fifth grade level? Condescending to whom? Fourth graders?" No, not at all. It is however trollish and in the realm of conversational terrorism when we aren't speaking about grammar and all you do is attack someone for it.

P79D5  Takuan, I've had dealings with hate zombies like this guy. It always leaves me wondering, what the heck would I do, if I had the power to do anything? Punish? Rehabilitate? Mostly, what I'd like to do is warn others that this guy is a toxic and potentially dangerous jerk. So I keep coming back to Neal Stephenson's forehead tattoos. That leaves the challenge of coming up with an informative diagnosis that is concise enough to fit on a face, and that allows others to read it from a minimum of a ten-foot pole's length away.

P81D5  Dear Pipenta: It all comes down to resources. A rich society should be able to salvage every salvageable member. Is America in this case, rich enough? Is this person worth saving? Intrinsically and in social efficiency? Is giving up on him morally equivalent to letting the weak die? Whose fault is he? His parents? His teachers? Those around him? Most here,including me, seem ready to let him slip under the waves. Or does everyone just hope he gets it together by himself before we really do have to kill him? I suspect if I talked to him personally, I would throw up my hands after an hour or two. That is prejudiced, but true. Ostracism isn't really a true solution - safer more immediately perhaps, but not addressing root causes. It's a conundrum. Take a look at this ### Takuan ### April 20 2008 4:28 PM

P84D5  A rich society should be able to salvage every salvageable member. Amen. I was once this guy. The problem with people like this is that they lack the self-awareness and self-assurance to be able to see themselves in remotely reasonable ways. It gets worse when two completely unrelated things get confused; in this case: Republican policy, and how obnoxious some Republicans are. They have nothing to do with each other, and their association just reflects confirmation bias on the part of the people doing the illegitimate associating. We saw a report here on BB a while back about a Democrat ripping atheists. No one said a word about this being "typical Democrat behaviour" despite the long history of close association between a particular type of evangelical Christianity and one wing of the Democratic party. Religion is a disease that knows no party in America, but it's fun for a doctrinaire lefty to paint the right with a nice broad brush. It's so much easier than being part of a reality-based community. People would rather depersonalize this guy and throw him into a box that they have marked out to contain people it's ok to hate. As soon as you find yourself thinking, "This guy deserves what he's getting" you know you've left the path of rational discourse and have entered a twisty maze of prejudices, all alike. No one deserves to be this guy. He's sad, crippled, and miserable. And he's probably so lacking in self-awareness that he doesn't even know. Take a look at this ### Tom ### April 20 2008 7:13 PM

P91D5  #77 KevinK my brother, there is a lot of distance between calling someone an "ignorant, stupid cunt" and what Noen and NickD were saying to you up there. That said, it IS hard to agree where to draw the line between verbal acts that deserve retaliation, and ones that don't. Legally, there are very few remedies for harm from mean verbal statements, unless they're threats of imminent harm (assault or stalking), or statements that are are untrue AND can be shown to have damaged someone's reputation (defamation). People hurt each other's feelings every day. You're legally allowed to hurt people's feelings. You just have to take the social consequences for your statements - which could include losing your job, in some cases. It seems that the opportunities for speech have increased powerfully as a result of the Internet, but the consequences for making unpopular speech have gotten more severe, too. I can't say I'm on board with the trend toward taking one bigoted, mean statement somebody makes, and turning that person into a whipping boy for the whole Internet. It might feel like justice, but I'm not sure it is. There are thousands of people who deserve our wrath more than this guy (rapists? murderers?). Takuan, I appreciate your thoughtful consideration of this guy's situation at #80. I would say that, at minimum, he deserves as much compassion as we'd give our own embarrassing, sexist, bigoted relative. (Does everybody else have one of these? I certainly do.)

But people here gleefully posting here with things like, "There's nothing quite like a moron who uses numbers to stab himself in the face" seem to me likely to stimulate exactly the kind of reactionary hostility that this guy is already full of. We're responding in a way that feeds his issues and preys on his weaknesses, and doesn't exactly show humanity at its best on our side either. Ostracism without hate is probably the best response to people like him. It gives him nothing but a vacuum to push against.

The 'Net offers us the opportunity to publicly shame people who behave badly, but none of the mechanisms of reconciliation with the community that more traditional modes of public shaming afford.

P1D6 Today's New York Times has a scary article about food shortages around the world, including heart-breaking slide shows and videos of people digging in dumps for morsels of anything with digestible calories. In Haiti, vendors are selling flavored mud to starving people. In Haiti, where three-quarters of the population earns less than $2 a day and one in five children is chronically malnourished, the one business booming amid all the gloom is the selling of patties made of mud, oil and sugar, typically consumed only by the most destitute. “It’s salty and it has butter and you don’t know you’re eating dirt,” said Olwich Louis Jeune, 24, who has taken to eating them more often in recent months. “It makes your stomach quiet down.” ### Mark Frauenfelder ### April 18 2008 12:16 PM | permalink

P7D6  I live in Haiti, and when I find news about Haiti it's often some variation on the story "people in Haiti are so poor they eat dirt". I think it may be more complex than that. I live in an area that is poor, but not especially poor by Haiti standards. The vendors selling candy on the side of the road will often have a stack of mud cakes next to the candy, and I have seen children choosing to buy them instead of candy - very odd. Apparently, only a particular kind of fine-grained clay is used, and it is mixed with butter and salt and flavored. Pregnant women especially seem to crave the mud cakes. I theorize that there are minerals in the mud that Haitians aren't getting from the standard rice and beans diet. I'm not saying that the statement "Haitians are so poor, they have to eat dirt" is 100% false, but I don't think poverty is the only reason for this. No, I haven't tried eating one yet.

P22D6  DloPwop: Yes, here in the southeast U.S., there is a long, long history of people (mostly poor, but not always) eating "dirt (and other "non-food" material, like laundry starch)," but not just because they can't get anything else. Sometimes it's pica (vitamin/mineral deficiency), but sometimes the material is considered, well, a local delicacy. I had a teacher in high school who grew up on a pig farm (his dad was the town pig castrator -- awesome! -- they had a chest freezer, my teacher said, chock full of "mountain oysters"), and he told stories of when he and his brothers and sisters were kids, they used to run out to the woods and look for "sugar dirt." Evidently this was some kind of very fine, dry, white clay you could find in little patches under trees -- they used to lick their fingers and tap the stuff, then lick it off their fingertips. My teacher said it wasn't the taste they liked so much as the special way it evidently crunched between the teeth. :) In some parts of the rural south you can even find "dirt" packaged in plastic, like steaks, in the fruit/vegetable areas of grocery stores. Of course the packages are labeled "not for consumption," but everybody knows that's just for John Law. I'm not saying they're not starving in Haiti (and hundreds of other places), but I thought I ought to back up the postulation that one man's dirt can be another man's...yummy dirt. I'll close with an aphorism of my great-grandmother's, used often in circumstances where some dumb grandchild had dropped a cookie on the ground -- it's a variation of the three-second rule, I guess: "Wall, you gotta eat a pecka dirt before you die, anyways. God made dirt and dirt don't hurt!" Maybe Haitians and Rebs are just trying to get it all down ahead of time. Take a look at this ### sugarbat ### April 18 2008 2:12 PM

P26D6  There's a lot more to the current food mess than bio-ethanol, and I'd be really interested in seeing posts and news articles from three years ago from all the smug folks who are now telling us that bio-ethanol is "obviously" wrong-headed. Hindsight is so easy. I've always been tepid on bio-ethanol because I thought it was energy-inefficient, and algal bio-diesel is so obviously superior in potential. But up until last year the "food problem" was that we were neck deep in the stuff without any efficient way to get it to the poor and hungry. We had poor farmers, too much food, and no efficient way to get it to the really poor people who needed it. I guess there have been experts who were aware that bio-ethanol could cause a food price spike, but it certainly never filtered down even to the semi-popular media. In any case, food prices are high now in part for the same reason that other commodity prices are high: booming demand from the developing world. What we are seeing is not a food shortage in the usual sense, but a food imbalance of a kind not totally dissimilar to what we had before, but with even less wiggle room for the poor. So to my mind the core of the problem really hasn't changed, and it is that we don't have a better way of getting food to the poorest people other than something like: 1) Donate aid money to possibly corrupt charities 2) Charities spend money on food and perks 3) Food is shipped to corrupt receivers in country with poor and needy people 4) Food is sold on the open/black market in country with poor and needy people For government aid, much the same process is used, but with the corrupt charities cut out and replaced by corrupt government officials. People who advocate for doing more of this kind of thing seem to me as blind as those who think that invading Iran will bring peace and stability to the Middle East. The sure sign of a doctrinaire moron is the belief that when your ideologically favoured policy fails, the correct solution is to do more of it. The charity/aid system is entirely unresponsive to the needs of the people at the bottom, who have no way of even expressing their needs because in the market needs are expressed in dollars and these people don't have any. Unfortunately, no better mechanism than markets have ever been found for organizing humans. If there had been, those better ways would have come to dominate our social organization instead of markets, which have deep and obvious flaws. We know with certainty that any form of top-down, centralized organization is poor, and that ethno-centric warlordism is far worse. Yet those two are the main competitors for markets as means of social organization. Democracy itself has always been an uneasy balance between listening to "the people" and listening to "the people's money", and again, the people who are in need here have so little money that they have very little democratic influence, even without the long history of egregious external interference in Haitian politics. So my own position on all this is: I don't have a clue what the solution is, and am deeply distrustful of anyone who says they do. External interference has not always been badly motivated, but it has always ended badly. This suggests that poor Haitians might actually be better off if we simply had the courage to leave them alone for a while. Certainly nothing else has worked, and it's kinda curious that the one place in the Caribbean that is the most isolated (Cuba) seems the least at risk for this kind of abject poverty, despite being a command economy of the most idiotic and vicious kind run by perfectly ordinary psychopaths who have their opponents jailed, tortured and killed for simply speaking their minds.

P29D6  In the case of Haiti bio-ethanol is a possible solution, not the cause of the hunger. The pig slaughter mentioned above is not an unusual event.

Biofuel is a possible way to turn that sugarcane into fuel and/or money.

So, to all the people criticizing the lady with 18 children. I live in Brazil and we are no strangers to famine and starvation here. Also it’s not uncommon to find families living in the rural areas and shantytowns of Brazil with a large offspring. This usually happens because the family uses the work force of their sons and daughters to work in the family land or helping in other activities that can bring more income to the family. But this is not the point here. What I find truly fucking ridiculous is for someone to assume that people living in some of the poorer areas of the world, living with less than $ 2 a day as pointed in the article, will use this money to by condom or contraceptives. Or perhaps you think that poor people can’t fuck. Since they can’t have proper houses, can’t have a drink, can’t have good clothes, can’t even have a decent meal, sure thing they can’t fuck either.

P40D6  John Kenneth Galbraith cites Haiti as an example of the Sub-Saharan African Model of underdevelopment (even though, obviously, it's not in Africa). That is, the core problem, according to him, is the lack of an educated middle class to administer the government. He traces this to the model of colonization employed in these countries, where "positions of skill and responsibility were until recently in the hands of non-Africans." (This in contrast to the Asian and South American models of colonization.) To quote further from his essay The Causes of Poverty: A Classification: The inadequacy of government reflects the absence of schools, colleges and cultural environment for producing or preparing people for public tasks. All discussion of economic development involves difficult problems of sequence and circularity. This is an example: How does a country get an educational system without an adequate government? How does it get a government without the qualified people that an educational system provides? There is no obvious answer. But it helps to have narrowed the problem to this point. For we then recognize that little is accomplished by action that does not break into this particular circle. Important to consider his advice before we start proposing a policy of non-intervention, or of merely sending pigs and condoms their way. One more bit from the essay: "No country is without some small group of honest and competent people in some area of economic activity or government. But in those countries where colonialism was exploitative or aggressive - where there was no liberalizing urge that sought to prepare people for some role other than that of primitive agriculture - this group is very small. . . . All that is needed is for the perilously small group of competent and honest people to be overwhelmed by those who see government in predatory and personal terms. At this point he specifically mentions Haiti. (It's an awesome book, Economics, Peace, and Laughter, Houghton Mifflin 1971.) Take a look at this ### Sister Y ### April 18 2008 4:57 PM

P42D6  Scenarios like this will only become more frequent. We've passed peak oil and yet we lack the political will or technological skill to develop alternative energy sources in sufficient amounts to replace fossil fuels so that business can go on as usual. The planet's ecosystem is critically unbalanced and human beings have multiplied beyond the capacity of the planet to sustain them without having what's left of its natural resources completely ravaged. The most likely consequence of all this is that the human population will crash. We are seeing the beginning of a long process of localized die-offs of the human species.

If they have two or three, they probably will. My point is that if China and India can rein in their populations (which they have done quite well compared to other poor countries), it is possible for Haitians to do it.

P49D6  Dear Antinous. As I said I’m a brazilian and we have the same sort of situation here in the poorer areas of the country, so if my comment was racist I would have been racist against myself. I do think people can make better choices than raising the number of members in a family to 20. This happens when people HAVE a choice. What I pointed was that expecting someone who has less than $ 2 a day to sustain themselves to spend this money in contraceptives is ridiculous. And it really is. Here in Brazil the number of child per couple is steadily decreasing over the last decades, this happened because the population started to have access to education, public health and family planning policies. What Haitians need, as anyone else, is economic development and state policies that grant them access to education and public health policies that offer them a choice other than misery and starvation. So then you can actually have a choice in the number of members in your family. I totally agree with you that a family of 20 members is not sustainable, but people living in these conditions are not guilty ones. They are the victims here.

When they become more affluent and feel more secure (and well fed) they switch to K-selection. Haiti is the poorest of the poor.

P57D6  Stefan Jones @37: I'm assuming you were responding to me with your remark about "so left to themselves they'll work things out". You then go on to say that not helping is as bad as "helping in the wrong way." My question is: what empirical evidence do you have that there is a right way to help? Can you show me one example of any nation anywhere that you consider to have been in a situation remotely similar to Haiti's today (grinding poverty, dysfunctional government, history of foreign intervention with various motives but uniformly negative outcomes) that has subsequently had its situation materially improved by foreigners "helping in the right way"? I'm not totally ignorant of world history in the 20th century, and I can't think of any such case. But I know that in many cases nations have tried to help. Yet it has always, every single time, been in one of the indenumerably infinite "wrong ways." Until I see an example that is plausibly similar I'm going to contend that the idea of "helping in the right way" is a phantasm, a myth to assuage the agony of not being able to do a damned thing about the suffering of our fellow-humans. Belief that there is something that could be done if only people would listen to you gives one a feeling of power in a situation where we are essentially and intolerably powerless.

China and India are not. Realistically, everyone on earth outside of the jungles of the Amazon and the Congo are aware of the existence of birth control and have heard about family planning. I don't believe that the good people of the Third World are too stupid to realize that there's a relationship between mouths to feed and starvation. Noen is correct to point out reproductive strategies. It is well within the intellectual reach of the most uneducated villager to see the need to change strategies in the face of limited resources. All that leaves in the way is condoms and ideology. I'm begging you to give these people some credit. They are not completely at the mercy of external factors.

P69D6  Victim-blaming is so cute. Anyway, the various fertility awareness methods are fairly effective, but only if you've been taught how to use them properly. Which requires: 1) that there are doctors to teach them 2) that the people who need/want to use them have access to these doctors (geographically, monetarily, etc) 3) that they have the supplies to use them (uh, thermometers - I have no idea how easy these are to find or how much they cost in poor areas of Haiti, but hopefully it's the smallest issue). Failure rates of FA methods vary between 3-25% depending on how well the user gets it. This isn't the easy-peasy "everyone knows how!" solution that Antinous is making it out to be. Heck, I had to do some research before I realized that there were non-obsolute natural contraceptive methods, and I'm a young, Western-educated woman who sees a gynecologist from an excellent American university hospital Through the luck of birth and circumstance, the chips are in my favor for access to this knowledge. Calling other people racist and patronizing for recognizing that there are people on this planet who haven't been as lucky education and health-wise as the folks in this discussion, and that this doesn't make them stupid or deserving of their problems, even if we think they would make different life choices with more access to information - well, jeez.

P75D6  Dear Antinous. I don’t know were you live but I assume it is in some place north of myself. I do not work directly in public health, but my graduation is in psychology and I read some texts dealing with human sexuality and public health in Brazil, published in scientific journals, related to policies of STD prevention implemented by the government here. Man you would be amazed to discover how that people living in poor conditions and having no access to information or education have no idea whatsoever about birth control strategies. Even if you are from some developed country I’m sure that you have had some friend in your live that got an unwanted pregnancy. Imagine how hard is to have the means to prevent an unwanted pregnancy when you have to live in a place like favela da maré, a shantytown here in Rio de Janeiro. My friend you have no idea what are the conditions of life there. I will not pretend that I have the answer for the problem that Haitians (or the population of other developing countries) are facing regarding birth control. But I do know that what is making a difference here in my country and that is granting the population access to information and increasing the range of the public health policy regarding STD and family planning.

P78D6  Hi there again Antinous. I’m also 100% in favor of birth control here my friend. It seems to me that we only disagree about the methods to achieve that in a developing country. I mean no offense man but you seem to think that the only thing that should be done, if even that at all, is to throw some condoms from an airplane and lets be done with that. I in the other hand believe that the solution for the problem of birth control in developing countries is solved through public health policies that grant universal access to contraception methods and education. I’m also 100% in favor of self-determination, people should be able to make their on choices and deal with the consequences. The thing that I’m pointing is that starving people in developing countries DOT’N have a choice. Not in the same way that you and I have. And that it is not right, as Rabican have pointed, to blame them for their misery. Especially if they live in places like a haitian or brazilian favela. That’s it my friend.

P79D6  Antinous, I believe Machinehead's point is that you just cannot assume people everywhere know what is obvious to you. Teens in the US get pregnant, for example, because they think they can't get pregnant the first time. Globally, some of the quotes from this report from the Guttmacher Institute are interesting (http://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/2007/07/09/FB_unmetNeed.pdf): "More than three in five married women in North Africa and West Asia with an unmet need [for contraception], nearly half in Latin America and more than one-third in South and Southeast Asia and in Sub-Saharan Africa are not using contraceptives because they do not believe they are at risk of getting pregnant." "Among never-married women in many countries, infrequent sexual activity is by far the most common reason for not using contraceptives, followed by the idea that they need not or should not begin contraceptive use until they are married." The brief also mentions that in some countries there are beliefs about the side effects of contraception that may deter use (which may or may not be accurate). Another thing to consider is whether or not the sexual partner of the woman is in favor of using a condom or other contraception. I appreciate that you seem to not want to underestimate the intelligence of women in Haiti or any other developing country, but intelligence is not the same as access to knowledge. These women will get this kind of knowledge (when they are actually at risk for pregnancy, what are the actual side effects of contraception, if any) more efficiently if someone from outside goes in to help them. It's definitely more complicated than "well, condoms are cheap and everyone knows about them, so what's the deal?" Take a look at this ### zinnia ### April 18 2008 10:19 PM

That's why I hate statements like that. They always get exaggerated. Again 20 years ago we ALL got sex education in the 6th grade. We are told and taught better. Now I am sure there are those that don't pay attention or whatever. But they days of girls being stupid about sex in the US are pretty much over. Especially with the advent of the internet.

P83D6  "Dear DloPwop: Have you further to help us out here?" Takuan: I'm not sure what I should comment on, Haitians eating mud cakes or birth control. I'm surprised nobody has asked me to go buy a mud cake and eat it so I can share with the group what they taste like. I'm game, but if nobody's interested I would prefer to snack on other things. I really appreciated Sugarbat's comments on eating dirt in the rural south. Imagine, dirt for sale in an American grocery store! It confirms that there is more to this practice than meets the eye. I don't have anything to say about birth control, but I might have insight as to why Haitians choose to have so many babies. It's definitely not lack of access to birth control. Virtually all the poor people I know here (the poor are about 99% of Haitians) have lost a child, a brother, sister, cousin, or all of the above. For the poor, family is everything, because they don't have much else. I would guess that women choose to have babies they may not be able to support because they have seen so many children lost, and need to be sure they will have close family throughout their lives. An article I read in the Economist called humans (paraphrased) "The only species that reproduces LESS when it has a surplus of food available to eat". It seems that when you look at the development of nations, stability comes first, eventually the food supply is stabilized, and then a generation or so goes by until childhood death becomes the exception to the rule and the birthrate comes down to a sustainable level. Haiti has a long way to go, and they need our help to give them and hand up and out of poverty. Take a look at this ### DloPwop ### April 19 2008 5:11 AM
P84D6  As someone else who lives here in Haiti I'd like to add my two cents, for what they may be worth. One thing I've learned since moving here is that when you are interacting with a culture so different from your own (I'm Canadian) the solutions to the problems that you see around you are never simple because the issues are not the result of any one thing, but rather a combination of things all working together. There's been a lot of discussion about high birth rates. It's true, Haiti has high birth rates, as do many third world countries. Being a woman I've had opportunity to talk to other women here and what I've learned are that there are many reasons for big families. In a country where people have very little materially that they can place value in, the wealth of an individual is often placed in the faces of their children. They see children as a gift and a blessing, even if they may not be able to meet the physical needs of that child. Women that don't have children in what is considered a culturally accepted time frame are often ridiculed by people in the community so there is a lot of social pressure. There is a heavy Catholic influence here and that does affect how people think. There is also a lot of superstition and a lack of education. Just a little first hand insight. That said, condoms and birth control are available. The hospital down the road from us will give women a hysterectomy or tubal ligation when they deliver, if they want to. There in lies the key though - it's a choice in the same way that I have a choice about whether or not I want to practice birth control and how I want to do that. I may not agree with what I see or all the reasons behind how people make their decisions, they are what they are. Working in the non-profit sector here I see a lot of different approaches to aid and development. From my personal experience, there are days where we feel like we're not making much progress, and others where we feel like we've accomplished something. I have to remind myself that Haiti's issues, like many developing countries, haven't become issues overnight - they have taken generations to form, and they will take generations to overcome. As a North American who grew up with so much right at my finger tips it's easy to expect that solutions should come quickly, but they don't. It's never as easy as throwing money around and addressing the issue en mass. It often means that my definition of "helping" needs to change. We often find that the most progress is made one person at a time, and that it happens through relationships, often in ways we don't expect. I also need to remind myself that my country was founded not so long ago by people that spent every day just trying to survive. They had had large families and no birth control. They often didn't know how to read and write and may or may not have been able to send their children to school. They died from diseases related to their sanitation and hygiene practices. They had to establish a form of government and a sense of justice. There may be many things here that leave me shaking my head in disbelief, but I believe that Haiti has the possibility of making something of itself, I just may not see it in my life time.

P87D6  KevinK, I didn't mean that _all_ teens think they can't get pregnant the first time they have sex, but some do. It's really surprising sometimes what people don't know or believe about sex, or biology, or science in general. I'm about your age (judging from when you were last a teenager), and I too had decent sex ed, but since then comprehensive sex ed has been replaced in a lot of places with some version of abstinence-only or less comprehensive sex ed. I'm in Minnesota (a relatively progressive state), and some people have been trying to get a bill passed requiring comprehensive sex ed in public schools for a few years now, and it's likely to get vetoed. So, I worry, maybe not quite so much about the birds and bees side of things, but certainly about the STD part of things and if kids know how to protect themselves before they become sexually active. As far as educating yourself from the internet goes, sure, there's some good info there, but then there are things like pro-anorexia and pro-suicide sites that make me wary of thinking teens will learn good health habits that way. Mmedlopwop and Dlopwop, thanks for your first-hand insights. Take a look at this ### zinnia ### April 19 2008 1:12 PM

P89D6  "The UN's special rapporteur on the right to food, Jean Ziegler, earlier blamed the crisis on biofuels, speculation on commodities markets, and EU export subsidies. "Hunger has not been down to fate for a long time - just as Marx thought," he told the Austrian newspaper Kurier am Sonntag. "This is silent mass murder." Food riots have broken out in at least a dozen countries, most notably in Egypt, Ivory Coast, Senegal, Yemen and Mexico. Pakistan has reintroduced rationing, while Russia has frozen the price of milk, bread, eggs and cooking oil. Indonesia has increased public food subsidies, while India has banned the export of rice, except the high-quality basmati variety. Earlier this month, Haiti's parliament dismissed the prime minister, and cut the price of rice, in an attempt to defuse widespread anger at food price hikes that led to days of protests and looting in the capital, Port-au-Prince. Thousands of garment workers in the Bangladeshi capital, Dhaka, also went on strike this month over spiralling prices. The price of rice, the staple Bangladeshi food, has increased by a third since a devastating cyclone last year. Experts say 30 million of the country's 150 million people could go without daily meals. The UN food agency has warned that it will need to make "heartbreaking" choices about which countries should receive its emergency aid, unless governments donate more money to buy increasingly expensive food."

P95D6  I can't remember who said they couldn't believe girls in America would believe you can't get pregnant the first time...but I was that girl. Alot of girls I knew believed that. I heard it from other girls like they did and we all reinforced that belief in each other. I heard so many crazy things like that when I was a teenager (during the 80s), you wouldn't believe it. Teenage girls are not so mature that they can discern scientific truth from rumors. And there was zero sex ed in our school district which was in a major metropolitan city. If no one tells a growing woman otherwise, she will believe these things into her adulthood. The hunger situation is also not just a third world problem. There are plenty of problems with distribution of food to the poor right here in America. I honestly think that greed is the number one reason that perfectly edible food is destroyed. For instance: someone I know works in a state-run food service institution, and they confiscate food and destroy it and refuse to give it to food banks because they say if they keep free food supplies short, then people will be forced to buy food, thereby keeping everyone involved in food production profitable. There is enough food to go around, and we will not run out of food. Rather, the situation is that more and more people are running out of enough money to buy food.

P96D6  aha! soon we will have them all. The Terminator Gene will make them bow down! Slaves! In lean times, biotech grains are less taboo By Andrew Pollack Published: April 21, 2008 Soaring food prices and global grain shortages are bringing new pressures on governments, food companies and consumers to relax their longstanding resistance to genetically engineered crops. In Japan and South Korea, some manufacturers for the first time have begun buying genetically engineered corn for use in soft drinks, snacks and other foods. Until now, to avoid consumer backlash, the companies have paid extra to buy conventionally grown corn. But with prices having tripled in two years, it has become too expensive to be so finicky. "We cannot afford it," said a corn buyer at Kato Kagaku, a Japanese maker of corn starch and corn syrup. Take a look at this ### Takuan ### April 21 2008 12:57 AM
P97D6  What's wrong with all you PC whiners out there? I'm reminded of a few "credos," among them... First, either nothing is off limits or everything is off limits. It's the South Park credo, and an apt one. While I'm not usually persuaded by slippery slope arguments, the censorship of humor IS a slippery slope, and one that is very important to watch. As soon as you say we can't make fun of poor people, the next group up the list whines that they should be off limits to (or some activist group whines for them), and as we acquiesce to group after group, we will find that nothing is left to laugh at -- except, maybe, quietly in our own homes. In "poor taste." Some people find poor taste, itself, funny, myself among them. That brings me to the next credo that I find apt. "Love is never wrong." I hear it invoked often in reference to homosexual rights, in which context I agree with it. The idea is that love is in short supply in this world and that we should focus on maximizing it OVER tailoring it (towards some notion of "appropriateness"). I think the same principle easily applies to humor. Laughter and humor are *intrinsically valuable.* As such, just like with love, it is better to maximize it than to worry about the appropriateness of each instantiation thereof. What is WRONG ("in poor taste" is such a silly moralistic concept) is increasing suffering. In this case, it would be wrong to point at them and laugh while they die (unless they felt better about the fact that their death could bring someone else some sort of happiness). To laugh over here is certainly not MORALLY wrong. "In poor taste" is not a moral ascription, but rather a knock at someone's psychological well-being, and an ill-conceived knock. If YOU don't find it funny, don't laugh. Why ruin everyone else's fun? I not only have the *right* to laugh at, and poke fun at, whatever I want -- I also believe that such humor and fun ADD value to the world. It's a good thing. Chill the fuck out. Take a look at this ### Xodarap ### April 21 2008 8:51 AM
P98D6  On another note -- I hate the "poor people shouldn't have 20 children" argument from the logically deficient. I hear it all the time even here in the U.S., in reference to a very different standard of "poor." We all have built into us by evolution the compulsion to continue the species. Our DNA uses us as vessels to keep itself alive and ever-progressing. In "normal" evolution, this is often described as "survival of the fittest," wherein adaptive mutations and behaviors increase the chances of survival, and therefore their own continuance. In humans, our goal is rarely "survival" as much as it is "success." Because of the dynamics of our societies make it much easier for those born rich to be "successful" than those born poor, we are forced to engage in behaviors that increase the likelihood that our DNA will somehow make it "to the top." That means that rich people typically only need one offspring (often for an entire extended family), who then has a very high chance of "success." Conversely, the poor have a low chance of their offspring making it "to the top" (or to a secure position on the ladder), so they have to hedge their bets. The only way in a modern economy to do that is to have many offspring. If a family has a 5% chance that their children will succeed in this world, then they should have 20 children. Unfortunately, they more likely have a 0.05% chance or so, but one can only have so many children. We are all driven by our DNA, so it is silly to judge people based on such ideals as the individual happiness quotients of each child in that family. We are driven towards a more distant future. I plan to have 20 kids just because I like my genes ;) ### Xodarap ### April 21 2008 8:51 AM
P1D7 The editorial staff of the UK's Bookseller magazine want you to know that lining your exterior walls with books is practically a moral imperative, since it reduces your energy costs and saves the world. You don't have to tell me -- I've been lining my walls with books for decades. In today's environment-conscious world, they also have another valuable function. "Books are the original insulator. A shelf of books along an outside wall works well to prevent heat escaping," says Joel Rickett.

P6D7  actually #2, the terms "exterior walls" or "outside walls" are correctly used here, since they normally refer to the walls of a structure that separate the inside from the elements, as opposed to the "interior walls", which form rooms inside the structure. and it's the exterior walls that need to be insulated. but i know what you mean! ;) Take a look at this ### aarrgghh ### April 20 2008 4:43 AM

It's a pretty cool idea nevertheless. I guess, though, that the increasing dominance of TV/games consoles/PCs over books in British culture will, indeed result in lessened insulation and increased heating bills...

P37D7  Also, I call shenanigans because books aren't good insulation anyway compared to other options. Since its really only about R-1 or R-2 per inch, even if you COMPLETELY covered your walls, 100% with books, thats really only about R-4 worth of insulation. Which is frankly, pathetic. Remove your bookshelves, and put a 1/2 inch polyeurathane expaned panel behind it, and you get better insulation than if the ENTIRE shelf was full 100%.

P38D7  There's already something on my exterior walls, called "windows." The book idea is harder to pull off in a warm climate (LA, in my case), where the windows are bigger than those dungeon-sized jobs that are usual in colder places. On the other hand, we don't have to crank as much heat here. Maybe this explains the alarming number of houses in LA with no books whatsoever. Take a look at this ### woid ### April 20 2008 11:52 AM

P41D7  40 posted by Agent 86 , April 20, 2008 2:01 PM “What’s the point of a bunch of books you’ve already read?” ----= I ask this of my wife all the time. She has a huge collection of books, (mostly complex serial 900-page sci-fi, historical fiction with lots of sex, purple capes, aliens and many big words that I have to look up, that she does not have to look up. She's as smart as me, and has a much bigger vocabulary.) Apparently, according to her, some people like to read a book more than once. This does not compute for me...I only do this with reference books, not fiction, because there's so much good fiction in the world, I figure "why read the same book when you can read another book?" But hey, to each their own. I mostly only have time to read manuals on using software and hardware these days anyway, and those are usually PDfs. I have about ten gigs of PDFs, and that's a pretty damn big library. And serachable. But I do still like printed books. They're easier to read, and I still have a "fetishist" like for the actual object, that goes back to a childhood spent skipping school to go to the library to actually *learn* something. And people tend to take printed books more seriously somehow. (Probably because it takes slightly more work to get them produced. Though with POD services like LightningSource and LuLu, not much more work.) Books are sort of on the way out, but not totally. Which is probably why authors who are not married to the old school (much of the publishing industry still is, actually), authors like me and Cory, tend to release books as both computer files and as mashed-up dead trees. I doubt printed books will ever be gone. I think that the infrastructure of the world will collapse in my lifetime, and we'll all be sitting in caves reading eBooks on hacked solar-powered iPods, and also reading printed books, though we will probably only read them once, because we'll have to burn them for heat. --Michael W.

Kinda reminded me of that Simpsons where the library in Springfield has a banner that says "We have books about computers!" This is not unique to England. It happens everywhere. (I almost wrote this sentence as "Sadly, this is not unique to England....", then mused about it, and thought "I'm not sure this is any sadder horse buggy makers going out of business when auto makers came to power.

P46D7  For all of those saying that books aren't great insulation, we understand. They aren't recommending that you rip out the drywall and install shelves between the studs so that your books take the place of insulation. They're saying that adding a layer of books adds to the insulating properties. So, if you go gung-ho and install great insulation, you can save even *more* energy by also putting a bookshelf along that wall. Michail W. Dean: I'm not so sure I could carpet my walls....

That was livable, barely, but then her bookophile mother died...so, at the joking suggestion of a friend, we opened a bookstore.

P52D7  One problem with using books for insulation is that they are generally made of virgin fibers that come from trees and logging those trees results in a large pulse of carbon to the atmosphere which contributes to global climate change. Forests are good places to store carbon because they are generally stable and long-lived. Wood products are not such good places to store carbon because we live in a throw away culture. Studies have shown that only about 15-24% of the carbon stored in forests ends up stored as wood products after logging, while the remaining carbon is emitted to the atmosphere as logging slash, milling waste, transport energy, etc. It's safe to say that for every kilogram of carbon in your house or in your books there is another three kilograms of carbon in the atmosphere. I am not arguing against books, but let's not let the feel good thing go too far. At best, using your books for insulation might be a good idea to help mitigate for the effects of logging.

P17D8  Why should the city get to decide the sole intended use of artefacts in public spaces? And why should no benches in a public space be sleepable-onable? My entirely respectable late father--M.D., F.R.C.S, and quite a few other letters besides--was known to fall asleep on a bench on occasion. The park my house faces has loads of benches, and sometimes people sleep on them, sometimes people sit on them, and sometimes people have sex on them (I'm not totally sure about that last, but I have observed one couple having a discrete and fully-clothed boink in the lea of large plinthe raised to commemorate a long-dead minister, out of sight of, well, everybody but me. So it's entirely plausible that the benches get used for it now and then.) Providing the public with a diversity of options as to how they use their public spaces seems to me sound social policy, and if there is a problem related to people sleeping on benches it seems to me that the problem is not fixed by eliminating the ability of benches to be slept upon. If the problem, for example, is that people sleeping on benches tend to be injection drug users and their discarded needles are a health hazard, a solution might be to ensure that safe injection sites exist. Unless, of course, you're willing to ignore the vast amount of data suggesting drug addition is a medical problem, not a moral problem. I admit to personal bias here: I once spent an uncomfortable night in Vancouver Airport sleeping on the floor due to the specially-designed "useless for sleeping" vinyl-sling-seated "benches" provided for travellers. The people who designed them clearly hated humanity, and probably their mothers besides. And yeah, Christopher Alexander rocks. Buildings and public spaces for people to live in! What a radical idea.

P76D8  I remember, back in the 90s, as a teenager, being able to spend a lazy summer day in the park, lying belly-up on a bench and reading a book. A nice conventional bench is great -- I can take a nap, or eat some food on it with a friend, whatever. So I appreciate people's disgust at seeing these benches that force people to sit, and only sit on them. But if you have lived in a large city with a chronic homeless problem, you may have a different opinion. See, I am sure that if they had nice benches in some of these parks, EVER SINGLE BENCH would be staked out and become the permanent living space of some transient. And while we, as a society should certainly try to address the underlying problems that create this situation, that shouldn't also prevent us from treating the immediate symptoms too. Unfortunately, the times we live in demand these measures. Take a look at this ### dequeued ### April 18 2008 9:07 AM
P77D8  @75, People don't sleep on benches because it's fun to sleep on hard metal/wood on a noisy public street in front of a lot of people. They sleep there because that's the best available option. That's the problem: Homeless people are in such a shitty situation that a place obviously very poorly suited for sleeping has become their best option for getting some sleep. Maybe if cities made an effort to create areas designed for sleeping, that wouldn't be the case. Micro-shelters, shelter-friendly architecture or outdoor "tent city" areas are good examples of this. These solutions may be somewhat more expensive, but they have the advantage of solving the problems of both groups, those who want to sit on benches as well as those who need somewhere to sleep. When there are enough people in a city who are so poor and desperate that they end up sleeping on all the benches, keeping benches available for sitting seems like an absurd priority to have.

P95D8  Even claiming to be a bodhisattva makes more sense. Oooooh. Busted. I believe that bodhisattvas are really common, but most haven't realized their potential.

P103D8  I'm all for the idea of reclaiming public space and thwarting designs that intentionally hamper the user's ability to make their own decisions, but these suits are ridiculous and yet another example of that "OH AIN'T I CLEVER" style of contemporary art that laughs at its own joke instead of actually trying to solve the problem it's allegedly addressing. By creating clothing that allows people to use these public areas as they see fit they've created clothing that can't be worn. (I mean, it CAN, but not really.) This stuff isn't art, it's anti-design. It's solving one problem by creating three more. If they had made special cushions designed specifically for public-space furniture, installed them, and then documented the results this would have been a neat design project. Too bad the artist was too busy patting herself on the back for her hilarious idea to do something that was actually useful. Take a look at this ### Doctor Pickles ### April 20 2008 8:40 AM

P1D9 The White House website hosts a photo of Dick Cheney "fly-fishing on the Snake River in Idaho," wearing a pair of reflective glasses.

It would just be a reminder he couldn't do anything with said naked woman anyway. You know how all the erectile dysfunction drug ads say their drugs are not for men too unhealthy for sex? They have half-undead old farts like Bum Ticker Cheney in mind when they say that. Besides, does this angry, misathropic crank even kiss the missus on the cheek any more?

P1D10 The Wall Street Journal reports that gun-clingers are not, in fact, bitter. According to the 2006 General Social Survey, which has tracked gun ownership since 1973, 34% of American homes have guns in them. This statistic is sure to surprise many people in cities like San Francisco – as it did me when I first encountered it. (Growing up in Seattle, I knew nobody who owned a gun.) Who are all these gun owners? Are they the uneducated poor, left behind? It turns out they have the same level of formal education as nongun owners, on average. Furthermore, they earn 32% more per year than nonowners. Americans with guns are neither a small nor downtrodden group. Nor are they "bitter." In 2006, 36% of gun owners said they were "very happy," while 9% were "not too happy." Meanwhile, only 30% of people without guns were very happy, and 16% were not too happy. In 1996, gun owners spent about 15% less of their time than nonowners feeling "outraged at something somebody had done." It's easy enough in certain precincts to caricature armed Americans as an angry and miserable fringe group. But it just isn't true. The data say that the people in the approximately 40 million American households with guns are generally happier than those people in households that don't have guns. The gun-owning happiness gap exists on both sides of the political aisle. Gun-owning Republicans are more likely than nonowning Republicans to be very happy (46% to 37%). Democrats with guns are slightly likelier than Democrats without guns to be very happy as well (32% to 29%). Similarly, holding income constant, one still finds that gun owners are happiest. ### Mark Frauenfelder ### April 21 2008 2:40 PM | permalink

P8D10  Target shooters of BB, Do you think about blowing someone away when you're at the range? If I were practicing archery, would people assume that I was thinking about killing someone?

If I were fantasizing about shooting someone, it would almost certainly cause me to lose concentration and my aim would suffer. Take a look at this ### Antinous ### April 21 2008 3:01 PM
P9D10  It's likely that a significant percentage of that 34% have an old gun that was given to them from a deceased relative or something, never shoot it, and don't even have ammo for it. Or they got it when they were going to be a hunter 20 years ago, went once, and discovered what a pain in the ass it is to actually hunt and put it away in the closet. These are the same people who would probably not blink twice, (or perhaps only twice) were their gun to become illegal and were asked to turn it in, or wouldn't care if it became increasingly difficult to get ammo, or whatever method ends up (note the implication there...) being the way they deal with making guns a little more difficult to get in this country. What I'm saying is that it's not the case that 34% of Americans are loony gun nuts who go bezerk when their constitutional right to participate in a militia is threatened. As to the connection between owning a gun and being happy, my guess is that there is some poor statistical correlation at work. Something like an increase in the sale of ice cream leading to more deaths by drowning. (they only SEEM related because they are both caused by hot weather...) Thus the comment by #3 about how expensive they are could play a factor, since guns are expensive, people with guns probably have more money, and yes Virginia, there is an actual statistical correlation between having more money and being happy. I read it a couple days ago in the NYTimes. Thus it is a fact. Happy Hunting! Jim Take a look at this ### JamesMason ### April 21 2008 3:03 PM

P11D10  It could be that people who are in areas that allow gun ownership are, in general, happier that people living in areas that don't allow gun ownership. I have several firearms, and I know that I would not be happy in any state that disallowed ownership, but only partially for the regulations themselves. Places like New York, Chicago, and San Francisco restrict firearm ownership the most. They also tend to have higher crime, higher real estate prices, higher taxes, and longer commutes than other places. Take a look at this ### Harrkev Author Profile Page ### April 21 2008 3:03 PM

P13D10  Gun ownership is a good wealth indicator. The cheapest gun I ever bought was a used Mossberg 88 pump shotgun for $120, and the cheapest handgun was $200, a used Ruger 95 9mm pistol. Ammo and range time are also expensive. It's not a hobby for those who struggle to make rent and buy groceries. Also, you are more likely to own a gun for protection if you have a home, a wife, kids, since you have something to protect. So basically, middle-class and well-off people tend to be happier and less bitter than struggling people. That's really what this poll is saying. You could probably take a similar survey of people who own backyard pools against those who don't and get similar results. Take a look at this ### primalchaos ### April 21 2008 3:10 PM

P15D10  I used to really enjoy target shooting (pistol and bow). I never felt the urge to go hunting; too much hiking for my tender, urban sensibilities. But target shooting was a hobby that my (now ex-)wife and I shared; I gave it up after we split and sold my pistols. As far as fantasies of violence go - there is a large divide between the stylized gunplay seen on TV and film and the rather grimmer reality - the idea that exposure to the realities of weapons would enhance or promote violent fantasies seems dubious to me. The relation between bore and degree of happiness is simple - those trapped by their macho self-image into target shooting with .50 caliber rifles and pistols can be seen weeping softly to themselves later as they grip their empty wallets; those who have graduated to the pleasures of a well-tuned Ruger MkII .22 caliber pistol leave the range whistling a happy tune!

P18D10  JamesMason #8, that was my first thought, but I read the post all the way to the end, where the author points out that, even controlling for income, the correlation still holds. Not that there's not some other factor causing both things, but apparently it's not mere income. Harrkev #10 has an interesting idea - perhaps the culture of the South (high concentration of gun owners there, based on my mucking through census data) leads people to want to own guns, and for those people to feel extra happy and socially comfortable - in general. In my case - all my male relatives own guns. They all live in Idaho. They're shy, quiet guys who hunt for meat (not for fun). Interesting story, thanks for posting it.

P20D10  Look. There is a certain amount of irreducible time between one's perception of being threatened by another person and the arrival of the police. This period varies from place to place and time to time. During this period, an individual has a absolute right to defend themselves, and an obligation to defend their family and/or others similarly threatened. I have a handgun for exactly that purpose. It threatens no one who does not first threaten me. I don't have possession of that handgun in China, where I presently live. That is because this government well understands that an armed population is more difficult to control than is the other kind. The passage in the Constitution regarding bearing arms was written by people who had just dealt with what they considered to be an oppressive government. Part of the reason Americans have the right to bear arms is to protect themselves from the tyranny of an out of control government, something like what we now have in the US. Before you jump to any conclusions, I am a left wing, Obama supporting, six figure income, CEO, and married for a grand total of 44 years, some of them happily (Thanks Al F.).

P25D10  #13 collect and run drills is spot on. collect, however, I dunno, (me) I am not obsessive, my guns are not like, oh, say, my super cool vintage balsa & tissue model airplane kit collection. (yes, I just scored an original Nobler in cellophane wrapping!) I actually have guns I have never shot, nor own ammo for. This was a topic of dinner conversation recently. The economy is going right straight to heck. The dollar is weak against the Euro. Stocks are plummeting like Paris Hilton's panties when a photographer is around. What can an average person invest a medium amount of money in, that will continue to appreciate faster than depreciate, is easy to hold as an asset, and has use no matter what? Well, I cannot buy super exotic cars. Although I understand the Ferrari Enzo rises 25% in value every time some rich guy crashes one. I do not want to touch gold. The Hunt brothers taught us you cannot corner the silver market. So what? Guns. Not a chicom sks but something a bit different, a bit collectible. The .44 Magnum Dirty Harry used, for example. If you bought a Smith & Wesson model 29 in 8" barrel for $500 in 1990, you got a deal. they are now running $1500 and up. So I have a proper gun safe, and every so often, I purchase a pistol or rifle, put it in the safe, and know, the value is appreciating. There is little maintenance cost. And if Zombies come for us, I stand a better than average chance. I am not sure if that makes me happier, or indulges any violent fantasies. But I know, if the dollar plummets in value, I will still be able to sell or trade some of these firearms for food for my family. It's just a thought, I am not suggesting it as a total portfolio strategy. Take a look at this ### cstatman Author Profile Page ### April 21 2008 3:30 PM

Miguel swiveled around in his office chair; "You always knew how to cheer me up with depressing crap like that M." .243 M77 turned away and watched her children play outside on a squeaking swing set. '5 years..' she thought. Just 5 years ago she was new out of the box. Factory fresh, with a spent .243 Winchester cartridge tucked away in a neat little envelope nuzzled next to her. Only 2 years of freedom.. then what? A middle-aged, cheap, silver tongued Italian shotgun with years of experience whisked her away to a Motel 6. The rest was straight out of daytime TV. She would never see the 200-yard range again. .243 M77 piped up quietly, "Did I ever tell you about the crush I had on you?" Miguel's typing paused almost imperceptibly. "It was at the club. You had just signed up and you were taking your first stroll around the ranges. You had some horrible looking thing with you, a crusty Remington with gaudy scope rings. I remember how she glinted in the sun, a slathering of Break-free on her worn, blued barrel. No doubt trying to cover up all those scratches." "Ah, 700... I remember her. I picked her up at some seedy consignment shop. She didn't last very long," Miguel chuckled. "You broke me in though, M, you taught me how to be happy on the range again." .243 glanced at the clock, Friday was drawing to a close. It was time for her children to leave, they were spending the weekend with their father. "I have to go, Miguel. Don't be so hard on yourself. Hey, I'll see you tomorrow at Ruger's Barbeque, right?" "Sure, I'll be there." Miguel couldn't help but smile as .243 M77 gently closed the door to his study. "A crush, eh?" Take a look at this ### sixister ### April 21 2008 3:36 PM

I do not ever want to shoot anyone, in fact if a dangerous situation should present itself I hope and pray that I never have to fire my gun. The thing is that places like New York, D.C. and Chicago have some of the toughest gun laws on the books, yet they also have some of worst gun violence.

P34D10  I don't buy the generalization that "an armed population is harder to control than an unarmed population," it's just the control is differently expressed. It looks to me like guns in the US serve symbolic purposes that prevent us from organizing to resist tyranny. At what point do we get or have we gotten armed resistance to government in recent years within the US? Mostly when there has been a fanatic religious group involved. It wasn't gun ownership that fueled resistance, it was a rival ideology where those who held it believed in it enough to challenge the government in an organized way. Having a world view that supports organized resistance to government does not require guns. And judging from recent examples in the US, having guns AND a rival world view doesn't seem to work out so well either.. Take a look at this ### ripley Author Profile Page ### April 21 2008 3:44 PM
P35D10  As a registered Democrat who owns an AK-47 and shoots in combat pistol/rifle matches, I find target shooting quite relaxing and meditative. One cannot be concerned with anything other than operating the weapon - not the day's events, not one's work. Just you and the target. Flow state, as suggested above. And it's not income, as the study corrected for that: "Similarly, holding income constant, one still finds that gun owners are happiest." I don't find the study surprising. Gun ownership is an empowering thing, and empowered people tend to be happy people. It has also been found that children that own legal guns have lower juvenile delinquency rates than children that don't own guns.

P38D10  Sister Y, the firearm is the most effective method of suicide, with something like 70% of firearm suicide attempts succeeding. So of course we're going to have a lot of people offing themselves with firearms, they happen to be effective. If someone wants to off themselves, let them do it. Most people try multiple times to kill themselves before succeeding. Having a gun in the home just means that a suicidal person is going to have to try less times to kill themselves before succeeding. People have the right to end their own life. IMHO, the whole "ban the guns to save suiciders" argument is a complete non-starter. Take a look at this ### jlbraun ### April 21 2008 3:53 PM

P45D10  I have a gun, but I can't say it's why I'm generally happy. In fact, I only have it through bizarre circumstances, not because I wanted it. I'd be just as happy a person without it. I'm pretty neutral about gun control, but I do wish there weren't so many handguns on the streets. My youngest brother is a gun nut, NRA all the way, goes shooting, has a full gun vault, subscribes to magazines, whole nine yards. He'll say he's happy, but he's usually discontented with one thing or another. So obviously there are different kinds of gun owners, with varying degrees of happiness, just like the general population. I'm pretty tired of studies like this. One small aspect of someone's life or personality mixed with some emotion doesn't really mean much in a larger societal picture. As we've seen on this board, people tend to see the word "Christian" and automatically there is a stereotype applied, completely ignoring the fact that there are different kinds of Christians, with very different beliefs and political persuasions. Any poll that says "X % if Christians think blah" says nothing, because some of those Christians are liberals, and some are conservatives. Same with gun owners; some are liberal, some conservative, some radical libertarians and others totally apolitical. Some are happy, some are depressed. Big whoop. Now that I think about, maybe some of the depressed gun owners shot themselves. Take a look at this ### Alan ### April 21 2008 4:10 PM

P48D10  @antinous I have been participating on other BB topics, sir. @andythebrit In 2005, there were 807 firearm suicides in teenagers in the US. In the same time period, 758 teenagers killed themselves by suffocation. Shall we ban ropes, garden hoses, and internal combustion engines? The austrians found that the rate of firearm licenses was *highly* correlated with the firearm suicide rate, but *uncorrelated* with the overall suicide rate, in the paper "Suicide by shooting is correlated to rate of gun licenses in Austrian counties". RESULTS: We found a strong correlation between the average gun license rate for the period 1990-2000 and suicides by shooting (r = 0.967), and only very weak correlation, and for some of the years under investigation a negative correlation, with other methods of committing suicide (r = 0.117) and the suicide rate in general (r = 0.383). A person that kills themselves with a gun is just as dead as one that kills themselves with a rope, but we won't call to ban ropes. Instead, we change the culture and talk to our children so they don't think that killing themselves is something they should pursue. @takuan What established fact was that?

P53D10  let's see; a link? a block quote? a link?.....nahh! too important to let the lazy pretend it didn't happen: February 8, 2008 - 7:01PM Super Bowl massacre averted at last minute Gary Grado, Tribune A distraught Tempe man was within sight of the Super Bowl on Sunday with an assault rifle, but a change of heart kept him from unloading 200 rounds of ammunition on the crowd, court records show. Gun in Super Bowl plot was banned, now popular Drunkenstein's bar name scares off Tempe Kurt William Havelock, 35, turned himself in Sunday to Tempe police and the FBI at the urging of family and confessed his plan, which he hatched in retaliation for the Tempe City Council rejecting a liquor license application for a restaurant and bar he owns. According to court records, Havelock is charged with mailing threatening communications in the mailing of eight copies of a “manifesto” explaining the planned massacre. “I will test the theory that bullets speak louder than words ... I will slay your children. I will shed the blood of the innocent,” Havelock wrote. “No one destroys my dream. No one.” Magistrate Judge Edward V. Ross said in a hearing in U.S. District Court on Tuesday: “I haven’t read more chilling words, and I’ve been doing this a long time.” Ross found Havelock was a danger to the public and ordered him held without bail. Havelock on Sunday mailed copies of the manifesto intended for friends and media from a post office at 59th and Peoria avenues in Glendale, but authorities were able to intercept them. In the letters he says his family has been attacked and the futures of his children have been destroyed. In October, Havelock was before the Tempe City Council to get approval for a liquor license application for a restaurant called The Haunted Castle, a Halloween-theme bar where horror-theme bands and actors could gather to promote themselves, according to city records. Liquor licenses are typically rubber-stamped by city councils, whose votes are only advisory. The State Liquor Board makes the final decision. Council members, however, got word from a blog written by Havelock that the business would be called Drunkenstein’s and questioned him about it. Havelock said there would be a sign with that name but would be only one corner of the business at 6463 S. Rural Road. The council voted 6-1 to deny the application, which is still pending before the liquor board. “Alas, this all boils down to an econopolitical confrontation. I cannot outvote, outspend, outtax, or outincarcerate my enemies,” Havelock wrote in the manifesto. “But for a brief moment I can outgun them.” According to court testimony by FBI Special Agent Philip Thorlin and Havelock’s father, Frank Havelock, he bought an AR-15 assault rifle on Jan. 29 from Scottsdale Gun Club. Thorlin described the rifle as the U.S. military’s weapon of choice. Havelock began Sunday by going back to the gun club for target practice, but there was a private function and he couldn’t get in. Besides the rifle, Havelock was carrying at the time six 30-round magazines and 20 loose rounds. Thorlin said Havelock’s original destination was Desert Ridge Marketplace in northeast Phoenix. It’s unclear according to court documents why Havelock changed his mind about Desert Ridge and headed for Glendale instead. He drove to different post offices in the West Valley to obtain the envelopes and postage for his copies of the manifesto and mailed them before he went to the parking lot of Jobing.com Arena, which can be seen from University of Phoenix Stadium, where a host of activities were happening before the 4:30 p.m. kickoff. “He waited about a minute and decided he couldn’t do this,” Thorlin said. Havelock then called his fiancee and met his parents at his Tempe condominium. “He was very upset, he was sobbing hysterically,” Frank Havelock said. “He said, ‘I’ve done something terribly, terribly wrong.’ ” Frank Havelock believed his son was talking about financial problems he was having with his restaurant, which the elder Havelock learned about for only the first time on Sunday, but then he confessed about the letters and the rifle. Frank Havelock said he went to his son’s car and moved the weapon and ammo to his car and persuaded him to turn himself into Tempe police. When authorities searched Havelock’s car, they found another typed letter to police with a handwritten note at the bottom that read: “do not resuscitate.” Havelock has no criminal history, and a mental health evaluation conducted at his arrest found “no mental defects” that would warrant a commitment to a mental hospital, Thorlin said. Frank Havelock said he’s never had any problems with his son. Neighbors who live next door said Havelock lived with his fiancee and two small children and two large dogs. Martin Trump and Danny Q. Rivera said Havelock kept to himself and had a variety of cars, including a white hearse with a vanity plate that read “drtnap.” They were shocked to learn of Havelock’s plan to use an assault rifle on crowds at the Super Bowl. “The Patriots versus the Giants — do you see the ironic parallel? How many dollars will you lose? And all because you took my right to work, to own a business, from me,” Havelock wrote in his manifesto. "Perhaps ( Web sites) will print up some cool t-shirts like I SURVIVED SUPER BOWL XLII." Take a look at this ### Takuan ### April 21 2008 4:40 PM

P58D10  @50 Fair enough, and I think there's some meat to that. The second most effective method of suicide is suffocation, and the methods to suffocate oneself are more widespread than guns. So if the unhappy were offing themselves, non gun owners would be offing themselves as well. There were 15635 non-firearm suicides in 2005, compared to 17002 firearm suicides. If 34% of people in the US own guns, and there are 17002 suicides by gun (all gun owners), and 15635 non-firearm suicides, then firearm suicides would remove a proportionally larger unhappy bit of the gun owners than the non-gun owners. For it to be a wash, there would be only half the firearm suicides as there were non-firearm suicides. Take a look at this ### jlbraun ### April 21 2008 4:51 PM

As far as the gun nut who thinks NYC and Chicago have some of the worse gun violence -- wrong. Try Houston, Miami, Atlanta, DC, and Baltimore. And why does DC and Baltimore have some of the worse? One word -- Virginia. Nice try. How many of the gun owners out here, and I could care less about most guns being owned, have actually used them to "defend their freedom?" Don't justify your gun fetish on that kind of bull crap.

Commie spies are executed. People complain in the expected manner and politicians are shuffled about. It's not really "guns or religion or [etc.]" that we bitter people cling to, it's whatever insignificant trope gives us a sense of self.

Owning a gun doesn't make you happy, maybe if you're happy you're more likely to buy a gun. I dunno. I do think that Sister Y has a point, in that gun owning people might be more successful in killing themselves when they choose to do so than non-gun-owning people, so unhappy gun owners might tend to be able to kill themselves at higher rates than average.

P80D10  Of course, the fact that this article is in the spotlight at all is proof of the phenomenon that Senator Obama pointed to (albeit in a way that was offhandedly mentioned and so quickly taken out of context). Gun control, when compared to Iraq, the economy, health care, and the environment, could just as easily be a non-issue in this campaign. But those issues are complicated, and it is more and more difficult to have a simple one word "yea or nay" response, or a sound byte solution to any of it. As people become less confident in their future being better than their present, or bitter about their circumstances, they seem to gravitate to issues that divide us quickly and cleanly like gun control. Fear-based arguments (zomg! ppl has teh guns!1!, or wtf!? ppl want to take mah guns!) have a calming effect because at least you know where you stand. The media and the candidates themselves invoke these issues when they want to play us, and typically when they have nothing better to say. But the point is that they distract us from the issues that really matter, that have the power to unite us toward a solution, and that unfortunately are much more difficult to define.

Obama's campaign has previously said he supports Washington DC's ridiculous handgun ban, and of course now is trying to wiggle out of that position. Oftentimes the positions a candidate takes on these sort of issues tells us a lot more than the policy speeches that other people write and the candidates regurgitate.

P104D10  statistics can be so misleading. What does it mean, even adjusted for income people with guns were still happier? Is it relative income or absolute income? If the average gun owner making $20,000 a year in Arkansas is happier than the average person making $20,000 a year in New York City that doesn't own a gun, and this is true for all incomes, can I say that even adjusted for income gun owners are happier? If so, it seems like the fact that more gun owners live in rural settings where the cost of living is lower would skew the results because the adjustment for income would be incomplete. To really have any experimental worth they would have take the guns away from people that have them and give them to people that don't have them and see how it affected the average happiness. Anything less is worthless given how many factors are at work here. Finally, (and most importantly) it may well be that those of us that don't own guns suffer decreased happiness because of the fact that other people do own them. In other words, my happiness may be low because I'm terrified of all the people that do have them. In fact, people that do own guns might be less happy due to fear of other people with guns, but simply be less affected because they also have a gun. Perhaps the average percentage of very happy people in a world with no private gun ownership is 40% for both former gun owners and non-owners. Trying to draw conclusions from a survey like this is worthless. Take a look at this ### number14 ### April 21 2008 7:15 PM

A few years ago my then-girlfriend-now-wife and I and a male friend made a trip there as part of a rather blurry and irresponsible evening out. For fun we were dressed all in black, with long coats and had silly nametags. Our friend may have been carrying an inflatable novelty sheep or he may have gotten that later, but anyway it was confiscated at a bar six hours later. We looked like maniacs and they shouldn't have trusted us an inch, but producing ID and a credit card was all it took to procure rented handguns, ammunition and range time for these three wacky strangers. America has a pretty lax attitude toward deadly weapons most times and places. I'm glad of that when I want to have a good time without being hassled but when I'm stuck in a 90 minute traffic jam in hot weather I wonder about the mental health of the people around me and just how easy it is for THEM to get a gun.

In Soto Zen, the Kyosaku is always administered at the request of the meditator, by way of bowing one's head and putting the palms together in gassho, and then exposing each shoulder to be struck in turn. In Rinzai Zen, the stick is requested in the same manner, but may also be used at the discretion of the Ino, the one in charge of the meditation hall. Even in such cases, it is not considered a punishment, but a compassionate means to reinvigorate and awaken the meditator who may be tired from many sessions of zazen."

P122D10  Takuan @ #69 "Firearm suicide rates are strongly impacted by the rate of gun ownership. (Kaplan and Geling, 1998)" So if you don't own a gun, it's harder to kill yourself with a gun? As surprises go, that would be right up there with a study revealing that deaths by motor car were extremely rare prior to 1900. It does not, however, say one thing about the overall suicide rate. If the same number of people snuff themselves without guns via hanging, drowning, pills or what-not, there would be no overall effect on the net suicide rate, so this statistic would be valid but meaningless. I believe when you look at gun ownership vs. overall suicide rate, it does end up having a definite correlation, but a very small one. (This is probably because suicide attempts with a gun are more likely to succeed than with most other methods.) Take a look at this ### Clifton Author Profile Page ### April 21 2008 10:34 PM

P1D11 Now that former Weather Undergrounder Bill Ayers is back in the news, this 2001 Slate profile of him is worth reading. He comes off as an extremely unsavory character. Much of what Ayers self-interestedly leaves out of his book is more personally embarrassing than illegal. Ayers takes care not to dwell on his own Establishment credentials. (His father was chairman of the energy company Commonwealth Edison, a fact Ayers conveys only by writing, "My dad worked for Edison.") Ayers omits any discussion of his famous 1970 statement, "Kill all the rich people. Break up their cars and apartments. Bring the revolution home, kill your parents, that's where it's really at." He also omits any discussion of his wife Bernardine Dohrn's famous reaction to the Manson killings, as conveyed by journalist Peter Collier: "Dig it. First they killed those pigs, then they ate dinner in the same room with them, then they even shoved a fork into a victim's stomach! Wild!" (In a 1993 Chicago Magazine profile, Dohrn claimed, implausibly, that she'd been trying to convey that "Americans love to read about violence.") ### Mark Frauenfelder ### April 21 2008 3:06 PM | permalink

Just saying, when it comes to men and dogs biting each other, the exception is the news; when it comes to defamation, they like to make things conform to stereotypes as far as is practicable, like here that people with radical politics are all middle class idealists completely out of touch with reality.

P6D11  Ayers was creepy in 1970, but was well respected in Chicago because of his subsequent work on education reform as well as reform of juvenile courts. The Chicago Tribune, a Republican paper, published op-eds from him repeatedly. He'd become practically mainstream, despite the fact that he never repudiated his support for violence as a means to oppose the Vietnam war. It appears that politicians of both parties in the Chicago area worked with the man at times over the last two decades. Ayers was never convicted of any crime (though this was mostly because blatant prosecutorial misconduct made the filing of charges impossible). However, two of his colleagues who were convicted of crimes were pardoned by Bill Clinton, which makes Hillary Clinton's attacks on Obama for once serving on a nonprofit board with Ayers look ludicrous. Also, the WU were pretty inept; they managed to blow themselves up. Take a look at this ### Joe ### April 21 2008 3:29 PM
P7D11  As usual the truth is somewhere in the middle. Whoever wrote that slate profile obviously has a conservative bias. The representation of The Days Of Rage as a vandalism spree with scant regard to the brutality of the police who outnumbered protesters is almost perverse. To suggest that Weather Underground bombs did indeed kill without backing it up also seems irresponsible. From this side of the pond it seems incredible that you waste time and energy debating the minor crimes of a man who may or may not be "unsavory" rather than contextualise his actions by referring to the moral bancruptcy of the Nixon administration. You never got around to impeaching a man whose actions were criminal beyond doubt, who was responsible for millions of dead on both sides of the South East Asian Conflict. In fact one of his co-conspirators, Henry Kissenger, lives amongst you now in luxury and seems destined never to be charged for the war crimes he committed.

Break up their cars and apartments. Bring the revolution home, kill your parents, that's where it's really at,'' is today distinguished professor of education at the University of Illinois at Chicago. And he says he doesn't actually remember suggesting that rich people be killed or that people kill their parents, but ''it's been quoted so many times I'm beginning to think I did,'' he said.

But to go along with this analogy, what if the abortion clinic bomber had only set off the bombs at night when the clinics were expected to be empty, sending warnings in advance to try to ensure that no one happened to be in the building? What if this had happened decades ago, and the person had already served their time in prison? Unlike murder, I don't think destruction of property is the sort of crime that should forever make one an outcast from polite society. Chicago Mayor Richard Daley has also weighed in with his own statement on the Ayers controversy: There are a lot of reasons that Americans are angry about Washington politics. And one more example is the way Senator Obama’s opponents are playing guilt-by-association, tarring him because he happens to know Bill Ayers. I also know Bill Ayers. He worked with me in shaping our now nationally-renowned school reform program. He is a nationally-recognized distinguished professor of education at the University of Illinois/Chicago and a valued member of the Chicago community.

P19D11  In the turbulent early 1970s, Ayers helped set off bombs in two dozen places, including the Pentagon and the U.S. Capitol. Supposedly nobody was hurt--the Weatherpeople always issued agitprop-laden bomb threats in advance--though Chatterbox has never seen a scrupulous accounting. (Ayers never did jail time for the bombings because of prosecutorial misbehavior.) --i only skimmed the article, but the above seems like the relevant section. And I note the scare word 'supposedly'. Sum mishtake, shurely, as that sort of thing is easily verifiable for a journalist? Prosecutorial misbehaviour sounds like code for trying to frame someone. That isn't to say he didn't do it, as I think John Barker said, the police can still frame you for a crime you actually committed. But it is comparable to war veterans: those who brag most tend to be those who did least. I do think the article is a defamation piece, rather then serious journalism, not that I condone any kind of violence. I had not heard of Ayers until the BB thread about the debate a few days back, and I certainly haven't read his book, but it seems anything to be said about Obamas relationship with him can correspondingly be said of McCains relationship to some nutterbutter or other on the right.

I think it would be the sort of crime to make one outcast permanently. Even if no one is in the clinic (which you can never be certain of) you are still putting lots of lives at risk. Emergency responders do get killed responding to incidents like this, and the point of the bombing is still to deprive individuals of their rights through terror and violence.

An idiotic faction of the Weatherman blew themselves up ONCE and after that the rest of the Weather Underground was always very careful to only harm structures... NOT people (very remarkably). There was only ONE incident of direct physical harm to humans and it was only to that faction of the Weatherman (3 Weathermen died in one explosion) -------- Here's what scares the hell out of the powers that be.

Not only does Ayers, for example, not thing he was wrong but as he told the New York Times "I don't regret setting bombs. I feel we didn't do enough."

P31D11  Jessie, I read your link, and the legal part of my mind still isn't convinced. Of course he had a lawyer read over his memoir, so there would be no confession in it, yet still enough juicy details to merit reading, but I definitely read the we part of the quotation as we, the WU, not we, as in Ayers and a few mates, specifically. Also you wont have failed to notice a strong bias in that article as well. There aren't many people who make themselves enemies of the state, put themselves at the mercy of the state by turning themselves in, and walk away, without so much as a fine or probation. Not even Roman Polanski. It simply wont do to look for an unambiguous confession in print; if there were real evidence I sincerely doubt he would be walking free right now. In my opinion, the likelihood is any bombing carried out by the WU probably was not centrally organised, but rather the work of a few people operating in secrecy; given the activities of the FBI at the time, of which the WU was aware, they would have had to assume infiltration. I doubt even Ayers would know for sure who did what. Also, I agree with you on the clinic/pentagon issue. First of all, they take bomb threats seriously in the US. Nobody will be allowed near something suspected to explode. and second, I think the WU/SDS were theoretical imbeciles, and had no excuse not to know better, but their activity cannot be thought of as existing in a vacuum. It was a response to the devastating US bombing of Vietnam, which was wrong by any standard. Of course the anti abortion people argue they are preventing a holocaust, and there's the rub.

And also, from Ayer's blog: http://billayers.wordpress.com/2008/04/06/episodic-notoriety-fact-and-fantasy/ Ayers explains his position, and [Spoiler Warning] he does not not think setting bombs was a mistake.

P38D11  It seems like most of the people commenting here know nothing at all about the Weathermen or the Weather Underground aside from what they read this week. It should go without saying that this is not a sound basis for condemning a man from society, even if only theoretically. First I have a couple of recommendations for the ill-informed. There was an excellent documentary made about the Weathermen in 2002. (imdb: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0343168/) His memoir is also a good read. As far as broader '60s history if you're actually interested it shouldn't be hard to find something. Come on. To #24 (Mr. Carnell): Exactly which rights are you suggesting that Ayers kept people from exercising? The right of police to illegally surveil citizens? The right of our government to defoliate another country halfway across the world and kill untold numbers of its people in the interest of geopolitical maneuvering? The Weathermen bombed primarily government buildings, from draft offices and police stations to the Pentagon. The "prosecutorial misconduct" under discussion is something you may have heard of before, and if not, then something you should surely look into. It was called COINTELPRO. Bill Ayers is a highly principled man. He fought for what he believed in, and whether you agree with his beliefs or not, you certainly have to respect that it takes much more chutzpah to do what he did than for the uninformed to criticize him in the comments section of a blog.

For the youth political movement, the seemingly ineffectual methods of peaceful protest and resistance led to the rise of an idealistic faction that want a more extreme approach that the Establishment could not ignore. This faction, called the Weather Underground, attempted to team up with the Black Panthers to violently confront the US government that started with street riots and escalating to bombing government targets. Thorough archival footage and interviews of the veterans of both sides of this conflict, this film covers the resistance movement's campaign of selective violence through this period until changing times and disillusionment brought it to an end while the FBI used unethical and illegal methods to hasten it.

P42D11  Brian Carnell wrote in #24: I take the opposite view, that in a free society people who engage in acts of violence in an effort to deprive others of their rights should be permanently ostracized by polite company, *especially* when they are completely unrepentant. Not only does Ayers, for example, not thing he was wrong but as he told the New York Times "I don't regret setting bombs. I feel we didn't do enough." So your objection to the hypothetical abortion clinic bomber is not primarily that he put lives at risk, but that it was done "in an effort to deprive others of their rights"? If someone was just blowing up buildings because of a pyromaniac urge, taking the same sort of precautions against the possibility that anyone would be inside them, would you be less inclined to make them a permanent outcast than the abortion clinic bomber? If "depriving others of rights" does loom large in your thinking, then as Gadfly said in #35, I don't really see how the bombings of the Weather Underground were an attempt to deprive anyone of their rights.

P43D11  Growing up in the U.S. of A. is not easy. A great book by James W. Loewen ," Lies my teacher told me" came out in 1995. He gave a breath of fresh air to history as a source to draw from to understand the reality of NOW. He also gave hundreds of examples showing politics massaging [spinning] history to suck in naive voters. The mind crap that passes for politics today is no different from the mind crap of our elitist , racist, sexists, slave loving, self serving manipulators we call our Founding Fathers. One major difference today is that a huge number of people have learned to get beyond the self serving lies and are putting real value into their lives. That includes getting pissed at a group of vicious Caucasians that have no business leading this country. Truth has never been served by our political system. Maybe the newly anointed millennium children have the sophistication needed to vote for people that don't insult us . Maybe the old dogs got enough left in them to avoid Death by Corporate America. Or, at least, Death by Florida or Arizona . Seems every time the Pope blows through it blows smoke to enable another War. A sharp, quick , surgical strike on Iran in Aug. To protect us from an Islamic Neuc is in play. Recommending to the Commander in Denial that he go down in the basement and play with his predator console to hunt Osoma Bin Evil and just take your act off the World stage is asking to much of a limited package. Look at the videos of Hitler's body language and compare megalomaniacs. They all dance the same. The net is terrifying to the terrorists. Like north Korea , China,and Corporate/political U.S.of A.[ not to mention the spiritual fraud of all fundamentalist beliefs in the name of Allah.} Rest assured that interesting times are ahead of us.

P59D11  @ #48 brian carnell there is a lot of that on the left. however, i think the bigger issue is that we get so much of the rightish slant that there comes a bit of the pendulum effect. in this particular case, i think that ayers has gotten such hard right treatment that more than a little rebalancing is needed. even some of the super-glowing praise he's getting is deserved, considering what they were up against, and how little everything else was working. of course, any examination of the weather underground has to include SOME criticism... even their own members critique themselves (bill included). but i am surprised that even boingboing bit some of the bait that's out there in the corporate media. it's a very one-sided view to imply that property destruction or theft or even violence is reprehensible when one considers that it was in the course of trying to stop millions of deaths. that's a hard argument to swallow. even buddhism considers killing to protect others to be a good idea (for boddhisatvas, but still...)

P91D11  MOON, 101 - repeating your argument doesn't convince people. and AGAIN, they didn't kill people with bombs. and yes, they did turn some folks off, but they also scared a lot of higher-ups into worrying about greater civil unrest at continuation for the war. by ruling out that property destruction may be useful to hastening the end of massive scale violence, you help to perpetuate a (violently) complacent mindset. IDLE UESDAY, i agree with you that there is a risk of killing people when you set bombs. but again, there is a risk of "killing" more people if you don't at times. property is less precious than human lives, and arguably a handful of lives is less precious than millions. it's a hrad choice either way, but what if the marches and the voting and everything else hasn't worked? as noen hinted at, we are kind of at that point now. i've marched, voted, done community organizing, street theatre, "culture-jamming", created media, done graffiti, gotten arrested, blocked roads, volunteered, done food drives, clothes drives, all that shit. we (the u.s.) still kill millions. not that all of that is useless, because it's not. it helps to educate people if nothing else. but it is still largely symbolic. direct action is still the most effective technique and the most noticed by the military-industrial complex. nearly every revolution has had destruction and violence and also had pervasive pacifism. they work in concert like yin and yang. the world is cyclic... a gyre!

I would be making an argument of the same form if I said "Moon, while the WU were making bombs, you were sexually molesting chipmunks in your back yard.

P103D11  Nelson Mandela (non-lethally) bombed buildings and laid the foundations for a guerilla struggle, too. Not to criticise him for that - the man is a saint, and his later actions produced a borderline miraculous outcome for South Africa, but just to point out that, contrary to popular rhetoric in the US, "terrorism" is not automatically evil. ### Kieran O'Neill ### April 22 2008 3:12 AM
P1D12 Nelson Mandela and other members of the African National Congress are on the US terrorist watchlist. ANC members who wish to travel to the USA have to get waivers from the State Department. The former South African Ambassador to the USA was flagged and delayed when she attempted to visit a dying cousin -- by the time the red-tape had been cut, her cousin was dead. "This is a country with which we now have excellent relations, South Africa, but it's frankly a rather embarrassing matter that I still have to waive in my own counterpart, the foreign minister of South Africa, not to mention the great leader Nelson Mandela," Rice said. Rep. Howard Berman, D-Calif., chairman of the House International Relations Committee, is pushing a bill that would remove current and former ANC leaders from the watch lists. Supporters hope to get it passed before Mandela's 90th birthday July 18. "What an indignity," Berman said. "The ANC set an important example: It successfully made the change from armed struggle to peace. We should celebrate the transformation." ### Cory Doctorow ### May 6 2008 3:23 AM | permalink

Two nights ago, I arrested an intruder on my property. Fortunately for me I was armed...as I always am (for when stuff like this happens), and I was able to subdue him by threat of force alone. I shouted to my wife to call the police. A visitor to my home also phoned the national emergency number (10111). Both of them spent more than 10 minutes just trying to get the persons who answered to GET THE STREETNAME RIGHT. Their huge station is 1.38 km from my house. Meanwhile my neighbour shows up, and we bind the suspect. Niegbour's wife phones the police station (1,380 meters away). After an unsuccessful attempt at getting help, she got into her car and DROVE THERE. On arrival, she had to first "fill in a form" before a vehicle would be dispatched to my house 1.38 km away. The following day I phoned them to ask them what's up. They had no recollection, no record, no knowledge of the incident. Kieran, what do I do? I have two young daughters in my house. I live in my "middle class white neighbourhood" because I have nowhere else to go. I am a middle class white. Take a look at this ### hobnob ### May 6 2008 6:29 AM
P19D12  The ANC was a terrorist organization... Apartheid was wrong, but Mandela's original approach was to use violence against innocents at a train station by planting bombs. That's why he was sent to prison. (He obviously shouldn't be on the list any longer) Violence was not what ended Apartheid, it was ended through peaceful means. But for those who think that everyone in the ANC has renounced violence, you should think again. Most likely the next president will be Jacob Zuma, a man already under suspicion of rape and corruption. One of his famous slogans during the struggle was "one settler one bullet." Moral clarity requires us to recognize that the response to evil is not more evil to balance things out. We can be opposed to apartheid and equally opposed to the opportunists who are exploiting the current situation. Mugabe is a good example of a leader fought injustice with injustice.

P23D12  #17 Yeah, I guess that's not an uncommon story. To be fair, there are plenty of similar stories in other countries. (There's a blog on which frustrated UK police complain about their inability to respond to crime as a result of the bureaucracy they're hampered with). As to what you do: 1. Lodge a complaint with the SAPS. The SAPS service number is 0860 13 0860. There is also a web system which lets you send a complaint directly to the station commander, which I have had success with (for a far smaller complaint than yours). Personally, I would use the web form first, then phone the 0860 number if that fails. 2. Write to/ email/ phone politicians. South Africa is a democracy, and government is, to some extent, contactable. Even if you can influence one or two, that can make a difference up the chain. 3. Protest about and raise awareness of the issue, but keep the issue clear: The issue is that there is excessive violent and other crime, and that the government is not doing enough to prevent it. (Admittedly, the rate is falling, so maybe they are having an effect?) As soon as you conflate crime with tinfoil hat conspiracy theories of condoned genocide, the government (and many other people) will stop taking you seriously. Also, if crime is what you truly care about (and it sounds like it is), keep it separate from the issues of corruption and crumbling infrastructure. (At least, outside of the context of the justice system.) The people you need to convince are the South African electorate and the South African government. Calling the entire government corrupt isn't going to get them to listen to you. As for your personal situation, you may also want to look into sector policing as a way of getting more involved with your local police force - it may help you (and others in your area) to get a better response in future. Take a look at this ### Kieran O'Neill ### May 6 2008 7:04 AM
P24D12  #18 As I understand it, the bombings under Mandela were strictly non-harmful. They certainly included sabotage of infrastructure, but great care was taken to ensure that people were not affected. It was only after Mandela went to jail that MK shifted towards targeting police and military and later civilians. Also, "One settler, one bullet" was a Pan African Congress slogan, while Zuma was in the ANC. I find it strange that you assert that it was a famous Zuma slogan. Don't get me wrong, he certainly was a guerilla, back in the day, and his singing of "Awuleth' umshini Wam'" ("hand me my machine gun") at his rape exoneration does little to inspire confidence in the man who will most likely be our next president, but please try to be correct in your criticism.

That's why he was sent to prison. (He obviously shouldn't be on the list any longer)" This is only partially accurate. The ANC was started in 1912 and tried peaceful nonviolence for decades. But nonviolence is only an effective strategy when you can shame your opponent -- nonviolence doesn't work against fascists who are willing to slaughter innocents and damn public opinion. The Sharpville Massacre in 1960 made it perfectly clear that the South African government was willing to stomach any atrocity in order to maintain apartheid. It was only after the Sharpville Massacre that the ANC formally created a military wing with Mandela at its head. I think it is very difficult to look at the ANC's position in 1960 and classify them as a terrorist organization. Black South Africans were completely excluded from meaningful political participation and violently attacked by the government. WTF other option did they have? If that's not a case where violence is morally permissible even with the full knowledge that inevitably innocents will be killed, it is hard to think of any situation that is.

P37D12  @34 wrote: "Please read about necklacing and the ANC's position on it, rather than believing the sensationalist newspapers/blogs you obviously use as "reliable" sources of information." The ANC's position on necklacing is very mixed. Yes, they denounced it, but it's also true that Oliver Tambo waited almost two years from the start of the necklacing to do so. OTOH, necklacing is something that would not have happened without the perverse nature of apartheid -- when people do not have access to legitimate authority, they will create their own authorities and we should not be surprised when these are filled with injustice and inhumanity. You can also see the sort of blinders that some ANC leaders clearly developed with today's example of Thabo Mbeki's ridiculous statements in support of Robert Mugabe (just the other day Mbeki said there was no crisis in Zimbabwe) among other things Mbeki has championed. Clearly, the ANC's decision to resort to violence in the 1960s worked and was probably the group's only real option. But the ANC paid a terrible price for that.

P48D12  Hobnob @17: Two nights ago, I arrested an intruder on my property. Allowing for the vagaries of geolocation, "your property" appears to be a house with a small amount of yard in Kensington, a thickly settled and very desirable old suburb known for its parks, private schools, upscale shopping, landscaping, and fashionable little restaurants. I notice you don't mention what this intruder was doing. How big was he? How old? Was he doing anything more threatening than trespassing inside the wall around your yard? Fortunately for me I was armed...as I always am (for when stuff like this happens), and I was able to subdue him by threat of force alone. A good thing, considering how close your neighbors' houses are to your own. I shouted to my wife to call the police. A visitor to my home also phoned the national emergency number (10111). Both of them spent more than 10 minutes just trying to get the persons who answered to GET THE STREETNAME RIGHT. Their huge station is 1.38 km from my house. That would be the Kensington Station, up at the intersection of Derby and Queen? Meanwhile my neighbour shows up, and we bind the suspect. Niegbour's wife phones the police station (1,380 meters away). After an unsuccessful attempt at getting help, she got into her car and DROVE THERE. On arrival, she had to first "fill in a form" before a vehicle would be dispatched to my house 1.38 km away. You're saying the police had no sense of urgency. That seems appropriate. An unarmed person trespassed on your property. Unless you're leaving something out, that's a misdemeanor. You responded by pulling a gun on the guy, then getting your neighbor to come over and help you tie him up. It sounds to me like you had the situation well in hand. And since Johannesburg does have a relatively high crime rate, it's possible the police were busy. What did you do with the fellow, by the way -- just keep him around until the police showed up to claim him? The following day I phoned them to ask them what's up. They had no recollection, no record, no knowledge of the incident. It was a misdemeanor trespass. The guy shouldn't have been in your yard, but he was removed from your yard, and I doubt he'll be back. What else were you looking to have happen? Kieran, what do I do? I have two young daughters in my house. I live in my "middle class white neighbourhood" because I have nowhere else to go. I am a middle class white. You live in a nice neighborhood. Kieran's statistics look pretty solid, and what they say is that the crime rate is still high, but it's been going down. If you never had to worry about crime before the ANC took power, then the crime rate must have been dreadful in neighborhoods that didn't have the advantages yours did. You share your country and city with a lot of very poor, very desperate people. Many of them show no inclination to die quietly and so decrease the surplus population. Many of them can read a map well enough to find your neighborhood. There are four ways to deal with the problem: (1.) You can murder them. (2.) You can ignore them, and hope the problem will go away. (3.) You can throw all your resources into keeping them out of your territory. (You already tried that. It didn't work.) (4.) You can support social programs that reduce the number of poor, desperate people in your vicinity. I recommend the fourth option. What should you do about it? Vote more money for education. You've got a large body of citizens who not that long ago were systematically oppressed and denied. Problems like that take a while to fix. A better educational system is a good place to start. Vote money for more civil order and public safety for everyone. This will help reduce the number of desperate nogoods committing crimes against people of all sorts, yourself included. Vote more money to treat AIDS, and for public health in general. You're living in the middle of a slow-motion pandemic. That's destabilizing and a hardship for any government in any country. Support your government while doing everything you can to improve and reform it. Alternately, you can vote to stick with a two-tier economy and an adversarial attitude. Just bear in mind that if the government fails and there's another revolution, the next one's going to be much, much nastier.

P49D12  Kieran @34, Noen usually does a lot better than that -- not that that's enough to save the vowels in that particular comment. minTphresh @43: Honest, the descendants of the Merovingians aren't shapechanging reptiles.

P51D12  RE: necklacing - let's not forget that the National Party apartheid government's third party agents were responsible for stirring up some of the worst violence in the run-up to the 1994 elections, playing off political and cultural rivalries between the Inkatha Freedom Party and the ANC. That's not to excuse atrocities like necklacing, but let's contextualise it. As for crime rates, Hobnob, my brother-in-law is a reservist on the South African Police's Crime Response Unit which is frantically overworked. They battle with budgets (his vehicle's siren and hooter is out of order, but the van doesn't get down-time for repairs because it's needed in action, which means he has to barrel through red traffic lights with only the lights to warn oncoming traffic). And yes, they struggle with communication - from crime victims who are so shocked they can't remember their own name, let alone address to radio personnel in the control room who aren't necessarily familiar with the area (Xhosa operators in Cape Town know streets in Langa backwards - and how to pronounce them - not so much Rondebosch, and vice versa for operators from the burbs. Let's not forget we have 11 national languages and an education system STILL recovering from apartheid) The cops also have people wasting their time from hoax calls to lonely old folks who call in and ask for a specific inspector to come check out their false alarm and have a cup of tea, calls to complain about loud music. I can't speak for your police station or the incident in question, but there is a possibility that they didn't respond because they were attending to a much more serious case. The cops are also horribly underpaid and given little respect in the community. In my cynical opinion, it's kind of obscene that police officers from low income areas like Khayelitsha who earn R2500 a month (US$331 or the equivalent of 100xMcMeals to put it in terms of buying power) and put their lives on the line have to deal with rich housewives whining about their R25 000 flatscreen TV being stolen. I'm astonished that there isn't MORE corruption (which is apparently very low among working cops who take their integrity very seriously, it's only when we get up to Jackie Selebi level that it goes to hell). And as bad as crime is (despite the falling crime rates, especially in Gauteng, where Hobnob lives, currently ranked second best province in the country to live mainly because of the sparking economy and rapidly dropping crime), it's VERY much worse in low income areas, where people can't afford private security firms, or heck, in shacklands like Nyanga, where much of the township doesn't have electricity. Those streets are very dark and very scary at night. Yes, crime is a problem. My middle class friends in nice suburbs bitch about break-ins or car theft or the occasional rare hijacking, but my friends from the townships have to deal with stabbings and gangsters and being shot in the leg for a cell phone, as happened a couple of months ago to a friend walking to the station. Again, let's put this is in context. It's not like crime started in 1994, it just got democratised. Take a look at this ### poptart ### May 7 2008 12:58 AM
P52D12  #47, #50: Teresa, Poptart, thank-you both. #49: Tak-kun, you may also appreciate Harold Strachan, a humble art teacher and columnist who has the perhaps dubious honour of having created the first bombs for the ANC military wing. He is a master of wit, and of what he calls "the concentration camp laugh". His account to the TRC of his experiences in an Apartheid-era prison is at once chilling and riotously funny. His columns are carried by the Witness (findable with a little searching) and Noseweek (pay site except for last month's issue). Here's some commentary on the Iraq war and Dubya: "So then, you will say, we should all as one nip it in the bud. Yes, but when and how does the disgusting thing start? Well you can start by stealing an election and feeding your purposefully dumbed-down electorate a lot of sanctimonious jingo blather about liberty and decency, and deceive them and lie and trick them into a merciless unlawful war against a sovereign state posing no threat to them, and take them beyond the point of no return. I’m talking about Hitler, of course." -Harold Strachan, from "Pale Mothers", last month's Noseweek. ### Kieran O'Neill ### May 7 2008 1:59 AM
